\begin{abstract}
  We present evidence that the prismatic and secondary prism facets of
  ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ crystals possess structural features that can
  reduce the effective hydrophilicity of the ice/water interface. 
  This is shown through molecular dynamics simulations of solid-liquid
  friction, where the prismatic
  $\{10\bar{1}0\}$, secondary prism $\{11\bar{2}0\}$, basal $\{0001\}$, 
  and pyramidal $\{20\bar{2}1\}$ facets are drawn through liquid water.  
  We find that the two prismatic facets exhibit roughly half 
  the solid-liquid friction of the basal and pyramidal facets, and compare
  this difference to an idealized surface with tunable hydrophilicity.
  These simulations provide evidence that the
  two prismatic faces have a significantly smaller effective surface
  area in contact with the liquid water. The ice / water interfacial
  widths for all four crystal facets are similar (using both
  structural and dynamic measures), and were found to be independent
  of the shear rate.  Additionally, decomposition of orientational
  time correlation functions show position-dependence for the short-
  and longer-time decay components close to the interface.

\section{Introduction}
Quiescent ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water interfaces have been studied
extensively using computer simulations. Hayward and Haymet
characterized and measured the widths of these
interfaces~\cite{Hayward01,Hayward02}.  Nada and Furukawa have also
modeled the width of basal/water and prismatic/water
interfaces~\cite{Nada95} as well as crystal restructuring at
temperatures approaching the melting point~\cite{Nada00}.

Expand the intro some more. What other work has been done studying ice/water
interfaces. Find some papers on ice surface hydrophobicity / philicity?

Understanding the surface properties of the different crystal facets
of ice is important in explaining atmospheric chemistry, where reactions
most commonly take place on the surface of ice crystals. 

Antifreeze proteins have been shown to interact differently with the various 
crystal facets of ice. The degree of interaction and relative hydrophilicities
of the crystal facets can be important in understanding and desgining more 
effective antifreeze proteins.

There is now significant interest in the \textit{tribological}
properties of ice/ice and ice/water interfaces in the geophysics
community.  Understanding the dynamics of solid-solid shearing that is
mediated by a liquid layer~\cite{Cuffey99, Bell08} will aid in
understanding the macroscopic motion of large ice
masses~\cite{Casassa91, Sukhorukov13, Pritchard12, Lishman13}.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, Samadashvili has recently shown
that when two smooth ice slabs slide past one another, a stable
liquid-like layer develops between them~\cite{Samadashvili13}. In a
previous study, our RNEMD simulations of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ shearing
through liquid water have provided quantitative estimates of the
solid-liquid kinetic friction coefficients~\cite{Louden13}. These
displayed a factor of two difference between the basal and prismatic
facets.  The friction was found to be independent of shear direction
relative to the surface orientation.  We attributed facet-based
difference in liquid-solid friction to the 6.5 \AA\ corrugation of the
prismatic face which reduces the effective surface area of the ice
that is in direct contact with liquid water.

In the sections that follow, we describe the simulations of
tribological properties using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics 
(RNEMD) for both ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water interfaces as well as a tunable
idealized surface, exposing a (111) surface to liquid water.  
These simulations give complementary results that point to the prismatic and 
secondary prism facets having roughly half of their surface area in direct 
contact with the liquid.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Construction of the Ice / Water interfaces}
Ice I$_\mathrm{h}$ crystallizes in the hexagonal space group
P$6_3/mmc$, and common ice crystals form hexagonal plates with the
basal face, $\{0001\}$, forming the top and bottom of each plate, and
the prismatic facet, $\{10\bar{1}0\}$, forming the sides.  In extreme
temperatures or low water saturation conditions, ice crystals can
easily form as hollow columns, needles and dendrites. These are
structures that expose other crystalline facets of the ice to the
surroundings.  Among the more common facets are the secondary prism,
$\{11\bar{2}0\}$, and pyramidal, $\{20\bar{2}1\}$, faces.  

We found it most useful to work with proton-ordered, zero-dipole
crystals that expose stripes of dangling H-atoms and lone
pairs~\cite{Buch:2008fk}.  Our structures were created starting from
Structure 6 of Hirsch and Ojam\"{a}e's set of orthorhombic
representations for ice-I$_{h}$~\cite{Hirsch04}.  This crystal
structure was cleaved along the four different facets.  The exposed
face was reoriented normal to the $z$-axis of the simulation cell, and
the structures were extended to form large exposed facets in
rectangular box geometries.  Liquid water boxes were created with
identical dimensions (in $x$ and $y$) as the ice, with a $z$ dimension
of three times that of the ice block, and a density corresponding to 1
g / cm$^3$.  Each of the ice slabs and water boxes were independently
equilibrated at a pressure of 1 atm, and the resulting systems were
merged by carving out any liquid water molecules within 3 \AA\ of any
atoms in the ice slabs.  Each of the combined ice/water systems were
then equilibrated at 225K, which is the liquid-ice coexistence
temperature for SPC/E water~\cite{Bryk02}. Reference
\citealp{Louden13} contains a more detailed explanation of the
construction of similar ice/water interfaces. The resulting dimensions
as well as the number of ice and liquid water molecules contained in
each of these systems are shown in Table \ref{tab:method}.

The SPC/E water model~\cite{Berendsen87} has been extensively
characterized over a wide range of liquid
conditions~\cite{Arbuckle02,Kuang12}, and its phase diagram has been
well studied~\cite{Baez95,Bryk04b,Sanz04b,Fennell:2005fk}. With longer
cutoff radii and careful treatment of electrostatics, SPC/E mostly
avoids metastable crystalline morphologies like
ice-\textit{i}~\cite{Fennell:2005fk} and ice-B~\cite{Baez95}.  The
free energies and melting
points~\cite{Baez95,Arbuckle02,Gay02,Bryk02,Bryk04b,Sanz04b,Fennell:2005fk,Fernandez06,Abascal07,Vrbka07}
of various other crystalline polymorphs have also been calculated.
Haymet \textit{et al.} have studied quiescent Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water
interfaces using the SPC/E water model, and have seen structural and
dynamic measurements of the interfacial width that agree well with
more expensive water models, although the coexistence temperature for
SPC/E is still well below the experimental melting point of real
water~\cite{Bryk02}. Given the extensive data and speed of this model,
it is a reasonable choice even though the temperatures required are
somewhat lower than real ice / water interfaces.

\subsection{Construction of the (111) solid/liquid interface with tunable hydrophilicity}
In order to compare the interfacial responses of the crystal facets of 
ice I$_\mathrm{h}$, an idealized solid/liquid interface was constructed.
This FCC solid was created with a lattice parameter of 3.92\AA~, and oriented
such that the (111) surface was exposed to the $z$-dimension. The mass of 
each atom in the solid was set to 18.016 amu, and the internal 
interactions were described by a Lennard Jones potential, with 
$\sigma = 2.475$ \AA~, and $\epsilon = 12.018106$ kcal/mol. The solid / liquid
cross interactions were defined to exist only between the solid and the 
oxygen site of the SPCE molecules. This cross interaction was described by
a Lennard Jones potential, with parameters $\sigma = 3.16549$ \AA~ and 
$\epsilon = 0.15532 \times \lambda$, where $\lambda$ takes on values of
(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0). The number of molecules 
comprising the
solid and liquid, as well as the dimensions of the simulation cell
can be seen in Table \ref{tab:method}.


\section{Shearing Simulations (Interfaces in Bulk Water)}
To perform the shearing simulations, the velocity shearing and scaling
variant of reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (VSS-RNEMD) was
employed \cite{Kuang12}. This method performs a series of simultaneous
non-equilibrium exchanges of linear momentum and kinetic energy
between two physically-separated regions of the simulation cell.  The
system responds to this unphysical flux with velocity and temperature
gradients.  When VSS-RNEMD is applied to bulk liquids, transport
properties like the thermal conductivity and the shear viscosity are
easily extracted assuming a linear response between the flux and the
gradient.  At the interfaces between dissimilar materials, the same
method can be used to extract \textit{interfacial} transport
properties (e.g. the interfacial thermal conductance and the
hydrodynamic slip length).

All simulations were performed using OpenMD~\cite{OOPSE,openmd}, with
a time step of 2 fs and periodic boundary conditions in all three
dimensions.  Electrostatics were handled using the damped-shifted
force real-space electrostatic kernel~\cite{Ewald}.

\subsection{ice/water interfaces}
The kinetic energy flux (producing a thermal gradient) is necessary
when performing shearing simulations at the ice-water interface in
order to prevent the frictional heating due to the shear from melting
the crystal. Reference \citealp{Louden13} provides more details on the
VSS-RNEMD method as applied to ice-water interfaces. A representative
configuration of the solvated prismatic facet being sheared through
liquid water is shown in figure \ref{fig:Shearing}. 

The interfaces were equilibrated for a total of 10 ns at equilibrium
conditions before being exposed to either a shear or thermal gradient.
This consisted of 5 ns under a constant temperature (NVT) integrator
set to 225~K followed by 5 ns under a microcanonical (NVE) integrator.
Weak thermal gradients were allowed to develop using the VSS-RNEMD
(NVE) integrator using a small thermal flux ($-2.0\times 10^{-6}$
kcal/mol/\AA$^2$/fs) for a duration of 5 ns to allow the gradient to
stabilize.  The resulting temperature gradient was $\approx$ 10K over
the entire box length, which was sufficient to keep the temperature at
the interface within $\pm 1$ K of the 225~K target.

Velocity gradients were then imposed using the VSS-RNEMD (NVE)
integrator with a range of momentum fluxes. The systems were divided
into 100 bins along the $z$-axis for the VSS-RNEMD moves, which were
attempted every time step.  Although computationally expensive, this
was done to minimize the magnitude of each individual momentum
exchange.  Because individual VSS-RNEMD exchange moves conserve both
total energy and linear momentum, the method can be ``bolted-on'' to
simulations in any ensemble.  All production simulations where data was 
collected and reported here were carried out in the microcanonical ensemble.

These gradients were allowed to stabilize for 1~ns before data
collection started. Once established, four successive 0.5~ns runs were
performed for each shear rate.  During these simulations,
configurations of the system were stored every 1~ps, and statistics on
the structure and dynamics in each bin were accumulated throughout the
simulations.  Although there was some small variation in the measured
interfacial width between succcessive runs, no indication of bulk
melting or crystallization was observed.  That is, no large scale
changes in the positions of the top and bottom interfaces occurred
during the simulations.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Solid-liquid friction of ice/water interfaces}
In a bulk fluid, the shear viscosity, $\eta$, can be determined
assuming a linear response to a shear stress,
\begin{equation}\label{Shenyu-11}
j_{z}(p_{x}) = \eta \frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial z}.
\end{equation}
Here $j_{z}(p_{x})$ is the flux (in $x$-momentum) that is transferred
in the $z$ direction (i.e. the shear stress). The RNEMD simulations
impose an artificial momentum flux between two regions of the
simulation, and the velocity gradient is the fluid's response. This
technique has now been applied quite widely to determine the
viscosities of a number of bulk fluids~\cite{Muller99,Bordat02,Cavalcanti07}.

At the interface between two phases (e.g. liquid / solid) the same
momentum flux creates a velocity difference between the two materials,
and this can be used to define an interfacial friction coefficient
($\kappa$),
\begin{equation}\label{Shenyu-13}
j_{z}(p_{x}) = \kappa \left[ v_{x}(liquid) - v_{x}(solid) \right]
\end{equation}
where $v_{x}(solid)$ is the velocity of the solid and $v_{x}(liquid)$
is the velocity of the liquid measured at the hydrodynamic boundary
layer, defined as the distance from the solid where the viscous flow is 
99$\%$ of the free stream velocity.

The simulations described here contain significant quantities of both
liquid and solid phases, and the momentum flux must traverse a region
of the liquid that is simultaneously under a thermal gradient.  Since
the liquid has a temperature-dependent shear viscosity, $\eta(T)$,
estimates of the solid-liquid friction coefficient can be obtained if
one knows the viscosity of the liquid at the interface (i.e. at the
melting temperature, $T_m$),
\begin{equation}\label{kappa-2}
\kappa = \frac{\eta(T_{m})}{\left[v_{x}(fluid)-v_{x}(solid)\right]}\left(\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial z}\right).
\end{equation}
For SPC/E, the melting temperature of Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ is estimated
to be 225~K~\cite{Bryk02}.  To obtain the value of
$\eta(225\mathrm{~K})$ for the SPC/E model, a $31.09 \times 29.38
\times 124.39$ \AA\ box with 3744 water molecules in a disordered
configuration was equilibrated to 225~K, and five
statistically-independent shearing simulations were performed (with
imposed fluxes that spanned a range of $3 \rightarrow 13
\mathrm{~m~s}^{-1}$ ).  Each simulation was conducted in the
microcanonical ensemble with total simulation times of 5 ns. The
VSS-RNEMD exchanges were carried out every 2 fs. We estimate
$\eta(225\mathrm{~K})$ to be 0.0148 $\pm$ 0.0007 Pa s for SPC/E,
roughly ten times larger than the shear viscosity previously computed
at 280~K~\cite{Kuang12}.

The interfacial friction coefficient can equivalently be expressed as
the ratio of the viscosity of the fluid to the hydrodynamic slip
length, $\kappa = \eta / \delta$. The slip length is an indication of
strength of the interactions between the solid and liquid phases,
although the connection between slip length and surface hydrophobicity
is not yet clear. In some simulations, the slip length has been found
to have a link to the effective surface
hydrophobicity~\cite{Sendner:2009uq}, although Ho \textit{et al.} have
found that liquid water can also slip on hydrophilic
surfaces~\cite{Ho:2011zr}. Experimental evidence for a direct tie
between slip length and hydrophobicity is also not
definitive. Total-internal reflection particle image velocimetry
(TIR-PIV) studies have suggested that there is a link between slip
length and effective
hydrophobicity~\cite{Lasne:2008vn,Bouzigues:2008ys}. However, recent
surface sensitive cross-correlation spectroscopy (TIR-FCCS)
measurements have seen similar slip behavior for both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic surfaces~\cite{Schaeffel:2013kx}.

In each of the systems studied here, the interfacial temperature was
kept fixed to 225~K, which ensured the viscosity of the fluid at the
interace was identical. Thus, any significant variation in $\kappa$
between the systems is a direct indicator of the slip length and the
effective interaction strength between the solid and liquid phases.

The calculated $\kappa$ values found for the four crystal facets of
Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ are shown in Table \ref{tab:kappa}. The basal and
pyramidal facets were found to have similar values of $\kappa \approx
6$ ($\times 10^{-4} \mathrm{amu~\AA}^{-2}\mathrm{fs}^{-1}$), while the
prismatic and secondary prism facets exhibited $\kappa \approx 3$
($\times 10^{-4} \mathrm{amu~\AA}^{-2}\mathrm{fs}^{-1}$). These
results are also essentially independent of the direction of the shear
relative to channels on the surfaces of the facets.  The friction
coefficients indicate that the basal and pyramidal facets have
significantly stronger interactions with liquid water than either of
the two prismatic facets.

\subsection{Solid-liquid friction of surfaces with tunable hydrophilicity}
In this section, we will discuss the idealized solid, presenting a (111)
surface to the liquid, in which the solid/liquid cross interactions are 
scaled. This results in a scaling of the relative hydrophilicity of the 
surface. These simulations were performed to complement the ice/water 
shearing simulations. 



\subsection{Structural measures of interfacial width under shear}
One of the open questions about ice/water interfaces is whether the
thickness of the interfacial 'slush-like' layer depends on the
facet of ice presented to the water.  In the interfacial region, the water
molecules are ordered differently than in either the solid or liquid
phases, and also exhibit distinct dynamical behavior.  The width of
this interfacial layer has been estimated by finding the distance
over which structural order parameters or dynamic properties change
from their bulk liquid values to those of the solid ice.  The
properties used to find interfacial widths have included the local
density, the diffusion constant, and both translational and
orientational order
parameters~\cite{Karim88,Karim90,Hayward01,Hayward02,Bryk02,Gay02,Louden13}.

The VSS-RNEMD simulations impose thermal and velocity gradients.
These gradients perturb the momenta of the water molecules, so
parameters that depend on translational motion are often measuring the
momentum exchange, and not physical properties of the interface. As a
structural measure of the interface, we have used the local
tetrahedral order parameter, which measures the match of the local
molecular environments (e.g. the angles between nearest neighbor
molecules) to perfect tetrahedral ordering.  This quantity was
originally described by Errington and Debenedetti~\cite{Errington01}
and has been used in bulk simulations by Kumar \textit{et
  al.}~\cite{Kumar09} It has previously been used in ice/water
interfaces by by Bryk and Haymet~\cite{Bryk04b}.

The local tetrahedral order parameter, $q(z)$, maps the local structural 
environment onto a tetrahderon, and is given by
\begin{equation}
q(z) = \int_0^L \sum_{k=1}^{N} \Bigg(1 -\frac{3}{8}\sum_{i=1}^{3}
\sum_{j=i+1}^{4} \bigg(\cos\psi_{ikj}+\frac{1}{3}\bigg)^2\Bigg)
\delta(z_{k}-z)\mathrm{d}z \Bigg/ N_z
\label{eq:qz}
\end{equation}
where $\psi_{ikj}$ is the $\angle_{O_{i}O_{k}O_{j}}$ angle formed between the 
oxygen sites of water molecules $i$, $k$, and $j$. Molecules $i$ and $j$ are
restricted to lie within the first solvation shell of molecule $k$ 
(typically $<$ 3.41 \AA\ for water), and the double sum is taken over all
possible permutations of the four closest neighbors of molecule $k$
meeting this criteria. 
$N_z = \int \delta(z_k - z) \mathrm{d}z$ is a normalization factor to 
account for the varying population of molecules within each finite-width bin.
The local tetrahedral order parameter has a range of $(0,1)$, where the
larger values of $q$ indicate a greater overlap with a perfect tetrahedron, and
indicates a larger degree of tetrahedral ordering
of the local environment.  In perfect ice I$_\mathrm{h}$ structures,
the parameter can approach 1 at low temperatures, while in liquid
water, the ordering is significantly less tetrahedral, and values of
$q(z) \approx 0.75$ are more common at $225$~K.

To determine the structural widths of the interfaces under shear, each
of the systems was divided into 100 bins along the $z$-dimension, and
the local tetrahedral order parameter was time-averaged in each bin for the 
duration of
the shearing simulation.  The spatial dependence of this order
parameter, $q(z)$, is the tetrahedrality profile of the interface.
The lower panels in figures \ref{fig:pyrComic} - \ref{fig:pComic} show
tetrahedrality profiles (in circles) for each of the four interfaces.
The $q(z)$ for the
bulk liquid was found to be $\approx~0.77$, while values of
$\approx~0.92$ were more common in the ice. The tetrahedrality
profiles were fit using a hyperbolic tangent function 
designed to smoothly fit the bulk to ice
transition while accounting for the weak thermal gradient, 
\begin{equation}\label{tet_fit}
q(z) \approx
q_{liq}+\frac{q_{ice}-q_{liq}}{2}\left[\tanh\left(\frac{z-l}{w}\right)-\tanh\left(\frac{z-r}{w}\right)\right]+\beta\left|z-\frac{r+l}{2}\right|.
\end{equation}
Here $q_{liq}$ and $q_{ice}$ are the local tetrahedral order parameters
for the bulk liquid and ice domains, respectively.
The locations $l$ and $r$ are the $z-$coordinate midpoints of the left and 
right interfaces, and $w$ is the interfacial width. 
The last term in eq. \eqref{tet_fit}
accounts for the influence that the weak thermal gradient has on the
tetrahedrality profile in the liquid region. Namely, that throughout the liquid
region of the box, the $\approx 10$~K thermal gradient results in a slightly 
smaller $q(z)$ value.

In panels
$b$ and $c$ of the same figures, the resulting thermal and velocity
gradients from an imposed kinetic energy and momentum fluxes can be
seen. The vertical dotted lines traversing these figures indicate the
midpoints of the interfaces as determined by the tetrahedrality
profiles.  The hyperbolic tangent fit provides an estimate of
$d_\mathrm{struct}$, the structural width of the interface.

We find the interfacial width as measured by the local tetrahedral order 
parameter to be $3.2 \pm 0.2$ \AA\ (pyramidal) and
$3.2 \pm 0.2$ \AA\ (secondary prism) for the control systems with no
applied momentum flux. This is similar to our previous results for the
interfacial widths of the quiescent basal ($3.2 \pm 0.4$ \AA) and
prismatic systems ($3.6 \pm 0.2$ \AA).

Over the range of shear rates investigated, $0.4 \rightarrow
6.0~\mathrm{~m~s}^{-1}$ for the pyramidal system and $0.6 \rightarrow
5.2~\mathrm{~m~s}^{-1}$ for the secondary prism, we found no
significant change in the interfacial width. The mean interfacial
widths are collected in table \ref{tab:kappa}. This follows our
previous findings of the basal and prismatic systems, in which the
interfacial widths of the basal and prismatic facets were also found
to be insensitive to the shear rate~\cite{Louden13}.

We have also used the local tetrahedral order parameter, as a means of 
labeling water molecules for further analysis. Here we have calculated
the intensities of hydrogen bonding by the donor / acceptors local
tetrahedral order parameter, as shown in figure. etc...

As a second structural measure of interfacial width, we have calculated
the local density, $\rho$, across the $z-$dimension of our ice/water systems. 
During equilibration and production simulations, $\rho(z)$ profiles of the 
systems were computed at each timestep. The density profiles were
monitored to ensure no melting or crystal growth was occurring. 
Each of the $\rho(z)$
profiles were fit in a similar way as the $q(z)$ profiles by a hyperbolic 
tangent, however there was no apparent thermal influence on the profiles
so the last term of eq. \eqref{tet_fit} was ignored. Figures 
\ref{fig:pyramidal_pqD} - \ref{fig:prismatic_pqD} show the $\rho(z)$ profiles
in red, and the $q(z)$ profiles were also plotted to guide the eye.

The similarity of these interfacial width estimates indicate that the
particular facet of the exposed ice crystal has little to no effect on
how far into the bulk the ice-like structural ordering persists. Also,
it appears that for the shearing rates imposed in this study, the
interfacial width is not structurally modified by the movement of
water over the ice.



\subsection{Dynamic measures of interfacial width under shear}
The spatially-resolved orientational time correlation function,
\begin{equation}\label{C(t)1}
  C_{2}(z,t)=\langle P_{2}(\mathbf{u}_i(0)\cdot \mathbf{u}_i(t))
  \delta(z_i(0) - z) \rangle,
\end{equation}
provides local information about the decorrelation of molecular
orientations in time. Here, $P_{2}$ is the second-order Legendre
polynomial, and $\mathbf{u}_i$ is the molecular vector that bisects
the HOH angle of molecule $i$.  The angle brackets indicate an average
over all the water molecules and time origins, and the delta function
restricts the average to specific regions. In the crystal, decay of
$C_2(z,t)$ is incomplete, while in the liquid, correlation times are
typically measured in ps.  Observing the spatial-transition between
the decay regimes can define a dynamic measure of the interfacial
width.

To determine the dynamic widths of the interfaces under shear, each of
the systems was divided into bins along the $z$-dimension ($\approx$ 1
\AA\ wide) and $C_2(z,t)$ was computed using only those molecules that
were in the bin at the initial time. For each ice/water interface investigated,
the following 0.5 ns simulations were computed;
quiescent simulations (where no thermal or momentum gradient was present), 
simulations with only a thermal gradient present, and simulations
where both thermal and momentum gradients were present.  
To compute these correlation
functions, each of the 0.5 ns simulations were sampled every 100 fs,
at which time the positions and
orientations of every molecule in the system were recorded. 

The time-dependence was fit to a triexponential decay, with three time
constants: $\tau_{short}$, measuring the librational motion of the
water molecules, $\tau_{middle}$, measuring the timescale for breaking
and making of hydrogen bonds, and $\tau_{long}$, corresponding to the
translational motion of the water molecules.

\begin{equation}
C_{2}(t) \approx a e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{short}} + b e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{middle}} + 
(1-a-b) e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{long}}
\end{equation}

In Figures \ref{fig:SPorient} - \ref{fig:Porient}, the $z$-coordinate
profiles for the three decay constants, $\tau_{short}$,
$\tau_{middle}$, and $\tau_{long}$ for the different interfaces are
shown, along with their fractional components of the overall total decay.
(Figures \ref{fig:PyrOrient} and \ref{fig:SPorient} are new results, 
and Figures \ref{fig:Borient} and \ref{fig:Porient} are
updated plots from Ref \citealp{Louden13}.)  In the liquid regions of
all four interfaces, we observe $\tau_{middle}$ and $\tau_{long}$ to
have approximately consistent values of $3-6$ ps and $30-40$ ps,
respectively.  Both of these times increase in value approaching the
interface.  Approaching the interface, we also observe that
$\tau_{short}$ decreases from its liquid-state value of $72-76$ fs.
The approximate values for the decay constants and the trends
approaching the interface match those reported previously for the
basal and prismatic interfaces. The contributions of the three
motions to the overall decay changes as we approach the interface
as well. At far reaches from the ice, the librataional motion 
and hydrogen bond breaking/making events 
contributes for about 20 percent of the decay, whereas frame 
reorientation contributes about 60 percent. As we approach the 
interface, the librartions and hydrogen bond dynamics both 
decrease in contribution to the decay. The librations comprise 
approximately 15 percent of the overall decay at the edge of the 
interface and advent of the ice, whereas the hydrogen bond dynamics 
contributions drop to approximately zero. The contributions
due to frame reorientation increase approaching the interface, and see
that at the advent of the ice these motions contribue about 85 percent
of the overall decay. 

We have estimated the dynamic interfacial width $d_\mathrm{dyn}$ by
fitting the profiles of all the three orientational time constants
with an exponential decay to the bulk-liquid behavior,
\begin{equation}\label{tauFit}
  \tau(z)\approx\tau_{liquid}+(\tau_{wall}-\tau_{liquid})e^{-(z-z_{wall})/d_\mathrm{dyn}}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{liquid}$ and $\tau_{wall}$ are the liquid and projected
wall values of the decay constants, $z_{wall}$ is the location of the
interface, as measured by the structural order parameter.  These
values are shown in table \ref{tab:kappa}. Because the bins must be
quite wide to obtain reasonable profiles of $C_2(z,t)$, the error
estimates for the dynamic widths of the interface are significantly
larger than for the structural widths.  However, all four interfaces
exhibit dynamic widths that are significantly below 1~nm, and are in
reasonable agreement with the structural width above.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we used RNEMD simulations to measure the solid-liquid
friction coefficient of solvated basal, prismatic, pyramidal, and
secondary prism facets of Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$, where the exposed crystal facet
is drawn through liquid water. We
have observed coefficients of friction that differ by a factor of two
between the two prismatic facets and the basal and pyramidal facets.
Because the solid-liquid friction coefficient is directly tied to the
inverse of the hydrodynamic slip length, this suggests that there are
significant differences in the overall interaction strengths between
these facets and the liquid layers immediately in contact with them.
This difference in interaction strength was further investigated by
RNEMD simulations of an idealized surface with tunable hydrophilicity.
From these simulations, we have seen that the friction coefficient 
doubled with a doubling of the cross interaction strength of the liquid
to the solid.

The agreement between these two measures have lead us to conclude that
the two prismatic facets have a lower hydrophilicity than either the
basal or pyramidal facets.  One possible explanation of this behavior
is that the face presented by both prismatic facets consists of deep,
narrow channels (i.e. stripes of adjacent rows of pairs of
hydrogen-bound water molecules).  At the surfaces of these facets,
the channels are 6.35 \AA\ wide and the sub-surface ice layer is 2.25
\AA\ below (and therefore blocked from hydrogen bonding with the
liquid).  This means that only 1/2 of the surface molecules can form
hydrogen bonds with liquid-phase molecules.

In the basal plane, the surface features are shallower (1.3 \AA), with
no blocked subsurface layer.  The pyramidal face has much wider
channels (8.65 \AA) which are also quite shallow (1.37 \AA).  These
features allow liquid phase molecules to form hydrogen bonds with all
of the surface molecules in the basal and pyramidal facets.  This
means that for similar surface areas, the two prismatic facets have an
effective hydrogen bonding surface area of half of the basal and
pyramidal facets.  The reduction in the effective surface area would
explain much of the behavior observed in our simulations.

% *****************************************
% There is significant interest in the properties of ice/ice and ice/water 
% interfaces in the geophysics community. Most commonly, the results of shearing
% two ice blocks past one 
% another\cite{Casassa91, Sukhorukov13, Pritchard12, Lishman13} or the shearing 
% of ice through water\cite{Cuffey99, Bell08}. Using molecular dynamics 
% simulations, Samadashvili has recently shown that when two smooth ice slabs 
% slide past one another, a stable liquid-like layer develops between 
% them\cite{Samadashvili13}. To fundamentally understand these processes, a 
% molecular understanding of the ice/water interfaces is needed.     

% Investigation of the ice/water interface is also crucial in understanding
% processes such as nucleation, crystal 
% growth,\cite{Han92, Granasy95, Vanfleet95} and crystal 
% melting\cite{Weber83, Han92, Sakai96, Sakai96B}. Insight gained to these
% properties can also be applied to biological systems of interest, such as 
% the behavior of the antifreeze protein found in winter 
% flounder,\cite{Wierzbicki07,Chapsky97} and certain terrestial
% arthropods.\cite{Duman:2001qy,Meister29012013} Elucidating the properties which
% give rise to these processes through experimental techniques can be expensive,
% complicated, and sometimes infeasible. However, through the use of molecular 
% dynamics simulations much of the problems of investigating these properties
% are alleviated.

% Understanding ice/water interfaces inherently begins with the isolated
% systems. There has been extensive work parameterizing models for liquid water,
% such as the SPC\cite{Berendsen81}, SPC/E\cite{Berendsen87}, 
% TIP4P\cite{Jorgensen85}, TIP4P/2005\cite{Abascal05}, 
% ($\dots$), and more recently, models for simulating
% the solid phases of water, such as the TIP4P/Ice\cite{Abascal05b} model. The 
% melting point of various crystal structures of ice have been calculated for 
% many of these models
% (SPC\cite{Karim90,Abascal07}, SPC/E\cite{Baez95,Arbuckle02,Gay02,Bryk02,Bryk04b,Sanz04b,Gernandez06,Abascal07,Vrbka07}, TIP4P\cite{Karim88,Gao00,Sanz04,Sanz04b,Koyama04,Wang05,Fernandez06,Abascal07}, TIP5P\cite{Sanz04,Koyama04,Wang05,Fernandez06,Abascal07}), 
% and the partial or complete phase diagram for the model has been determined
% (SPC/E\cite{Baez95,Bryk04b,Sanz04b}, TIP4P\cite{Sanz04,Sanz04b,Koyama04}, TIP5P\cite{Sanz04,Koyama04}). 
% Knowing the behavior and melting point for these models has enabled an initial 
% investigation of ice/water interfaces. 

% The Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water quiescent interface has been extensively studied 
% over the past 30 years by theory and experiment. Haymet \emph{et al.} have 
% done significant work characterizing and quantifying the width of these 
% interfaces for the SPC,\cite{Karim90} SPC/E,\cite{Gay02,Bryk02}, 
% CF1,\cite{Hayward01,Hayward02} and TIP4P\cite{Karim88} models for water. In 
% recent years, Haymet has focused on investigating the effects cations and 
% anions have on crystal nucleaion and 
% melting.\cite{Bryk04,Smith05,Wilson08,Wilson10} Nada and Furukawa have studied
% the the basal- and prismatic-water interface width\cite{Nada95}, crystal 
% surface restructuring at temperatures approaching the melting 
% point\cite{Nada00}, and the mechanism of ice growth inhibition by antifreeze 
% proteins\cite{Nada08,Nada11,Nada12}. Nada has developed a six-site water model
% for ice/water interfaces near the melting point\cite{Nada03}, and studied the 
% dependence of crystal growth shape on applied pressure\cite{Nada11b}. Using 
% this model, Nada and Furukawa have established differential 
% growth rates for the basal, prismatic, and secondary prismatic facets of 
% Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ and found their origins due to a reordering of the hydrogen 
% bond network in water near the interface\cite{Nada05}. While the work 
% described so far has mainly focused on bulk water on ice, there is significant
% interest in thin films of water on ice surfaces as well.  

% It is well known that the surface of ice exhibits a premelting layer at 
% temperatures near the melting point, often called a quasi-liquid layer (QLL).
% Molecular dynamics simulations of the facets of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ exposed
% to vacuum performed by Conde, Vega and Patrykiejew have found QLL widths of
% approximately 10 \AA\ at 3 K below the melting point\cite{Conde08}.
% Similarly, Limmer and Chandler have used course grain simulations and 
% statistical field theory to estimated QLL widths at the same temperature to
% be about 3 nm\cite{Limmer14}.
% Recently, Sazaki and Furukawa have developed an experimental technique with 
% sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to visulaize and quantitatively
% analyze QLLs on ice crystals at temperatures near melting\cite{Sazaki10}. They 
% have found the width of the QLLs perpindicular to the surface  at -2.2$^{o}$C 
% to be $\mathcal{O}$(\AA). They have also seen the formation of two immiscible
% QLLs, which displayed different stabilities and dynamics on the crystal 
% surface\cite{Sazaki12}. Knowledge of the hydrophilicities of each
% of the crystal facets would help further our understanding of the properties 
% and dynamics of the QLLs.
  
% Presented here is the follow up to our previous paper\cite{Louden13}, in which
% the basal and prismatic facets of an ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water interface were
% investigated where the ice was sheared relative to the liquid. By using a 
% recently developed velocity shearing and scaling approach to reverse 
% non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (VSS-RNEMD), simultaneous temperature and 
% velocity gradients can be applied to the system, which allows for measurment
% of friction and thermal transport properties while maintaining a stable 
% interfacial temperature\cite{Kuang12}. Structural analysis and dynamic
% correlation functions were used to probe the interfacial response to a shear, 
% and the resulting solid/liquid kinetic friction coefficients were reported.
% In this paper we present the same analysis for the pyramidal and secondary 
% prismatic facets, and show that the differential interfacial friction 
% coefficients for the four facets of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ are determined by their 
% relative hydrophilicity by means of dynamics water contact angle
% simulations. 

% The local tetrahedral order parameter, $q(z)$, is given by
% \begin{equation}
% q(z) = \int_0^L \sum_{k=1}^{N} \Bigg(1 -\frac{3}{8}\sum_{i=1}^{3}
% \sum_{j=i+1}^{4} \bigg(\cos\psi_{ikj}+\frac{1}{3}\bigg)^2\Bigg)
% \delta(z_{k}-z)\mathrm{d}z \Bigg/ N_z
% \label{eq:qz}
% \end{equation}
% where $\psi_{ikj}$ is the angle formed between the oxygen sites of molecules
% $i$,$k$, and $j$, where the centeral oxygen is located within molecule $k$ and 
% molecules $i$ and $j$ are two of the closest four water molecules
% around molecule $k$. All four closest neighbors of molecule $k$ are also
% required to reside within the first peak of the pair distribution function
% for molecule $k$ (typically $<$ 3.41 \AA\ for water). 
% $N_z = \int\delta(z_k - z) \mathrm{d}z$ is a normalization factor to account 
% for the varying population of molecules within each finite-width bin.


% The hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of a surface can be described by the
% extent a droplet of water wets the surface. The contact angle formed between
% the solid and the liquid, $\theta$, which relates the free energies of the 
% three interfaces involved, is given by Young's equation.
% \begin{equation}\label{young}
% \cos\theta = (\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})/\gamma_{lv}
% \end{equation} 
% Here $\gamma_{sv}$, $\gamma_{sl}$, and $\gamma_{lv}$ are the free energies
% of the solid/vapor, solid/liquid, and liquid/vapor interfaces respectively.
% Large contact angles ($\theta$ $\gg$ 90\textsuperscript{o}) correspond to low 
% wettability and hydrophobic surfaces, while small contact angles 
% ($\theta$ $\ll$ 90\textsuperscript{o}) correspond to high wettability and 
% hydrophilic surfaces. Experimentally, measurements of the contact angle
% of sessile drops has been used to quantify the extent of wetting on surfaces
% with thermally selective wetting charactaristics\cite{Tadanaga00,Liu04,Sun04},
% as well as nano-pillared surfaces with electrically tunable Cassie-Baxter and 
% Wenzel states\cite{Herbertson06,Dhindsa06,Verplanck07,Ahuja08,Manukyan11}. 
% Luzar and coworkers have done significant work modeling these transitions on 
% nano-patterned surfaces\cite{Daub07,Daub10,Daub11,Ritchie12}, and have found 
% the change in contact angle to be due to the external field perturbing the 
% hydrogen bonding of the liquid/vapor interface\cite{Daub07}.

\caption{\label{fig:PyrOrient} The three decay constants (panels a, b, c)
  of the orientational time correlation function, $C_2(z,t)$, 
  and their fractional contributions to the overall decay (panels d, e, f), 
  for water as a
  function of distance from the center of the ice slab. The vertical
  dashed line indicates the Gibb's dividing surface of the solid and liquid
  regions of the pyramidal ice/water interface as determined
  by the local order tetrahedral parameter. The control system with no
  applied kinetic or momentum flux (black circles), the 
  system with only a kinetic flux imposed (red squares), and
  sheared (blue diamonds) simulations with both kinetic and momentum fluxes
  present were fit using a shifted-exponential decay (see eq \eqref{tauFit}).
  In panels (b) and (c) approaching the interface, the moderate and long time 
  decay constants 
  (corresponding to jumps between hydrogren bonds and frame reorientation, 
  respectively) increase in value, indicating a slow-down in their 
  corresponding dynamics. However, in panel (a) we see the short time 
  contribution (the librational motion of the hydrogen bond) speeds up 
  approaching the ice/water interface, due to the constrained motion of the
  molecules. In panels (d) and (e), the fractional contribution of the short 
  and moderate decay times decreases approaching the dividing surface, with
  the moderate time contribution going to zero near the edge of the ice. The
  decay due to frame reorientation (panel f), increases as the liquid 
  molecules become more crystalline, as the dominant form of orientational 
  decay within the ice is long time diffusion.}
