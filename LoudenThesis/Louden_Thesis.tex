\begin{abstract}
  Friction at the surface of ice is characterized by the extent a
  surface premelt lubricates the two opposing surfaces. In the
  hydrodynamic regime, the material traversing over the ice surface is
  fully supported by the quasi-liquid layer (QLL), and the resulting
  friciton is comprised of three parts; the friction due to the QLL
  passing over the ice surface, the viscous shearing of the surface
  premelt, and the capillary bridges forming between the QLL and the
  material. In this dissertation I present molecular simulations
  exploring these contributions. 

  Water sliding over the surface of ice is observed to be in the
  no-slip limit. A friction coefficient appropriate for these boundary
  conditions is presented, and crystal facet dependent friction is
  observed. This trend is observed over multiple water potentials, and
  is shown to correlate strongly with the surface hydrogen-bond
  density. A momentum transmission model is proposed, which predicts
  tribological properties at these interfaces.

  A temperature dependence study of the surface premelt at the basal
  and prismatic termination of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ is presented. The
  QLL structure is determined by structural and dynamic properties,
  and the shear viscosity of the surface premelt is quantified.

  I would like to thank my advisor, Professor J. Daniel Gezelter, for
  his countless hours of explanation, teaching, and encouragement. I
  would like to thank my parents, for without whom I would not be
  where I am today. All of your years of sacrifice and encouragement
  have contributed to this document, and I am forever thankful for
  your help.

  I am also grateful to my undergraduate research adviser and close
  friend, Prof. Christopher Lawrence. He opened the door to the world
  of physical and computational chemistry, and his infinite
  patience and guidance have helped shape me into the scientist I am
  today. 

  I am grateful to past and present group members, Dr. Shenyu Kuang,
  Dr. James Marr, Dr. Kelsey Stocker, and Dr. Madan Lamichane. I am
  deeply grateful to Dr. Joseph Michalka for all the years of guidance
  in programming and discussions of theoretical chemistry. I am
  thankful for the Corcelli and Maginn groups for their useful
  discussions on my research. I also am thankful for the excellent
  courses taught by Prof. Steven Corcelli, Prof. Jindal Shah,
  Prof. Bruce Bunker, and Prof. J. Daniel Gezelter.  I would like to
  acknowledge all the excellent discussions with my research
  committee, Prof. Steven Corcelli and Prof. Edward Maginn

  I would be amiss if I did not acknowledge my close friends,
  Dr. Robert Graff, Dr. Eric Hansen, and Tiffany Snow. For the many
  days and nights we spend talking about research and the endless
  suggestions given, and the nights we spent playing board games, you
  will forever be my close friends.

  Lastly I must thank my wonderful wife, Elizabeth Louden. Her
  continued support and understanding have meant the world to me. Her
  ability to melt my stress away and make me smile continues to
  astound me.

  Computational resources were provided by the University of Notre
  Dame Center for Research Computing. Financial support for this
  research was provided by the National Science Foundation under Grant
  CHE-0848243 and the University of Notre Dame Department of Chemistry
  and Biochemistry.

% The \unnumchapter command allows you to include an unnumbered chapter as part of
% the main text before Chapter 1. It will appear in your table of contents, and you
% should have at most one such chapter (although nothing in the class file will
% prevent you from creating more).
