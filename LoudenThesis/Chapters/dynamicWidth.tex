\section{Dynamic Measures of an Ice / Water Interface Under Shear}\label{structure}

\subsection{Reorientation of Water Molecules}
The spatially-resolved orientational time correlation function,
\begin{equation}\label{C(t)1}
  C_{2}(z,t)=\langle P_{2}(\mathbf{u}_i(0)\cdot \mathbf{u}_i(t))
  \delta(z_i(0) - z) \rangle,
\end{equation}
provides local information about the decorrelation of molecular
orientations in time. Here, $P_{2}$ is the second-order Legendre
polynomial, and $\mathbf{u}_i$ is the molecular unit vector that bisects
the HOH angle of molecule $i$. The angle brackets indicate an average
over all the water molecules and time origins, and the delta function
restricts the average to specific regions in the $z$-dimension. 

In the ice crystal, decay of $C_2(z,t)$ is incomplete, while in the
liquid, correlation times are typically measured in ps. Observing the
spatial transition between the decay regimes can define a dynamic
measure of the interfacial width. To determine dynamic widths of the
interfaces under shear, each of the systems were divided into bins
along the $z$ axis ($\approx$ 1 \AA\ wide) and $C_2(z,t)$ was computed
using only those molecules that were in the bin at the initial
time. For each ice / water interface investigated, the following 0.5
ns simulations were computed: quiescent simulations (where no thermal
or momentum gradient was present), simulations with only a thermal
gradient present, and simulations where both thermal and momentum
gradients were present. During these simulations, the positions and
orientations of each molecule were recorded every 100 fs.

  little decay represents water molecules in the ice, while the band
  that decays quickly corresponds to bins in the liquid.  The
  correlation function presents a continuous distribution of decay
  behaviors across the interface between ice and liquid water.}

Recently, Laage and Hynes have determined the mechanism for water
reorientation.\cite{Laage2006,Laage2008} Using molecular dynamics
simulations, they found that water reorients by breaking a hydrogen
bond with an overcoordinated first-shell neighbor, and makes a large
angle jump to form a new hydrogen bond with an undercoordinated
second-shell neighbor. The hydrogen bond cleavage and molecular
reorientation occur in a concerted fashion, not in successive steps as
was previously thought. With this detailed picture, they constructed
the Extended Jump Model\cite{Laage2006,Laage2008} based on the Ivanov
Jump Model and parameters extracted from their molecular simulations;
the average jump amplitude of the rotational jump, $\theta_{0}$, and
the frequency of the jumps, $1/\tau_{0}$. After accounting for
molecular frame reorientation, the Extended Jump Model is able to
predict reorientation relaxation times, $\tau_{n}^{jump}$, which agree
with experimental results as well as estimates obtained from
simulations where fast librational motion is ignored.

Computed $C_2(z,t)$ values have previously been fit to a
triexponential decay, with three time constants:
$\tau_\mathrm{short}$, measuring the librational motion of the water
molecules, $\tau_\mathrm{middle}$, measuring the timescale for the
large angle jumps during the breaking and making of hydrogen bonds,
and $\tau_\mathrm{long}$, corresponding to the translational motion of
the water molecules.\cite{Louden2013a} The Extended Jump Model also
includes three similar decay constants, however two of them are linked
and the dynamics of the decay is governed by two parameters. Since we
are interested in how the decay times and the individual contributions
may change through the interface, we have fit the $C_2(z,t)$ data
with
\begin{equation}
  C_{2}(z,t) = a~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{short}} + b~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{middle}} + 
  (1-a-b)~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{long}}
\label{eq:c2}
\end{equation}
where all of the decay constants are considered local functions of the
$z$ coordinate. In Fig. \ref{fig:SPorient}, the $z$-coordinate
profiles for the three decay constants, $\tau_{\mathrm{short}}$,
$\tau_{\mathrm{middle}}$, and $\tau_{\mathrm{long}}$ for the secondary prism interface
is shown, along with their fractional components of the overall total
decay, ($a$, $b$, $1-a-b$), respectively. Similar figures for the
other interfaces are provided in the Supporting Information.

In the liquid regions of all four interfaces, $\tau_\mathrm{middle}$
and $\tau_\mathrm{long}$ consistently approach $3-6$ ps and $30-40$
ps, respectively.  Both of these times increase closer to the
interface.  Conversely, $\tau_\mathrm{short}$ decreases from a
liquid-state value of $72-76$ fs approaching the interface.

The fractional contributions of the three motions to the overall decay
changes as we approach the interface as well. Far from the ice, the
librational motion and hydrogen bond breaking/making events each
contribute to about 20 percent of the total decay, whereas frame
reorientation contributes about 60 percent. As we approach the
interface, the librations and hydrogen bond dynamics both decrease in
contribution. The librations comprise approximately 15 percent of the
overall decay at the edge of the interface, whereas the hydrogen bond
contributions drop to approximately zero. In contrast, the fraction of
the total decay due to frame reorientation is shown to increase
approaching the interface.  The time constant corresponding to this
motion is seen to logarithmically increase as we approach the interface
as the molecules become more ice-like. In the ice we would expect
molecular reorientation to be incomplete, however, at the interface we
observe frame reorientation to contribute 85 percent of the overall
decay.

\end{figure}

The middle and long decay times diverge inside the ice crystal, so the
orientational rate, $k(z) = 1 / \tau(z)$ can be used to identify a
dynamic interfacial width for the interface by fitting the profiles of
the middle and long-time orientational rates with a function that goes
smoothly between bulk-like liquid behavior and the crystal,
\begin{equation}\label{tauFit}
  k(z) = \frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{liquid}} - \frac{1}{2~\tau_\mathrm{liquid}} \left(
      \tanh \left( \frac{z-l}{d} \right) - \tanh \left( \frac{z-r}{d} \right) \right)
\end{equation}
where $l$ and $r$ are the locations of the Gibbs dividing surfaces,
and $d$ is a dynamic width.  As with the structural widths,
$10\%-90\%$ dynamic widths are easily computed from the fits
($d_\mathrm{10-90} = 2.197~d$).  These values are provided in Tables
\ref{tab:propsSPCE} and \ref{tab:propsTIP4P}. All four SPC/E
interfaces exhibit dynamic widths that are $\sim 11$~\AA, and are
larger than the structural widths computed above.  In TIP4P/Ice at
270K, the dynamic widths are $\sim 14$~\AA, also larger than the
structural widths in for these interafaces.

We note that Bryk and Haymet also calculated the orientational time
correlation function at the basal interface of SPC/E
water,\cite{Bryk2002} and observed the same qualitative trend through
the ice / water interface, although the spatial resolution was not
sufficient to resolve a dynamic width.
 
\subsection{Spatial resolution of Hydrogen bond jump rates}
The spatially-resolved hydrogen bond jump correlation function,
\begin{equation}\label{jump}
C_\mathrm{jump}(z,t) = 1 - \langle n_a(0) n_b(t) \delta(z_i(0) - z) \rangle
\end{equation}
measures the decorrelation of a hydrogen bond on molecule $i$ as it
transitions between one acceptor ($a$) and another ($b$). $n_a(0)$ is
set to one if hydrogen $i$ is bound to acceptor $a$ at time $0$, and
is zero otherwise.  Absorbing boundaries are utilized with this
correlation function; switches from $b$ back to $a$ at a later time
are considered a new jump, and the angle brackets indicate an average
over all donor hydrogens and time origins. Laage and Hynes determined
the bulk version of this function had \textit{single}-exponential
decay in room temperature water.

A version of this correlation function was used to investigate how
water molecules reorient around
ions\cite{Laage2007,Laage2008a,Stirnemann2011a,Laage2011},
proteins\cite{Duboue-Dijon2014}, and in confined
spaces\cite{Laage2012b,Fogarty2014}.  Laage and Hynes studied how the
strength of the hydrogen bond might perturb the reorientation
dynamics,\cite{Laage2006a} and found the librational motion which
forms a cone around the O-O vector is smaller for more strongly
hydrogen bonded water. This may also provide a partial explanation for
the increasing contribution of short time orientational decay very
close to the ice surfaces.  Since the solid creates an excluded volume
for the water molecules that are in proximity to the interface, the
hindered range of motion (i.e., a smaller cone around the O-O vector)
manifests as faster librational decay.

As an additional measure of a dynamic width of the quiescent
interfaces, each of the systems were divided into bins along the $z$
axis ($\approx$ 1 \AA\ wide) and $C_\mathrm{jump}(z,t)$ was computed
(see Fig. \ref{fig:SPkjmp} and Fig. \ref{fig:SPTIP4Pkjmp}).
Like Laage and Hynes, we find that within each spatial region, the
decay is easily fit with a single exponential, yielding a local
hydrogen bond jump time. The jump times diverge inside the ice
crystal, so the jump rate, $k_\mathrm{jump}(z) = 1 / \tau_0(z)$ can be
used to identify a hydrogen bond jump width for the interface in a
similar manner to the dynamic width. $k_\mathrm{jump}(z)$ was fit with
a hyperbolic tangent (see Eq. \eqref{tauFit}) and the 10-90 jump
width, $j_\mathrm{10-90}$, is shown in tables \ref{tab:propsSPCE} and
\ref{tab:propsTIP4P}.

\caption{\label{fig:SPkjmp} Upper: Hydrogen bond jump correlation
  functions, $C_\mathrm{jump}(z,t)$, collected in 1 \AA~bins across
  the SPC/E secondary prism ice / water interface. The band that
  experiences very little decay represents water molecules in the ice,
  while the band that decays quickly corresponds to bins in the
  liquid.  The correlation function presents a continuous distribution
  of decay behaviors across the interface between ice and liquid
  water.  Lower: $C_\mathrm{jump}(z,t)$ decays exponentially, and each
  1 \AA~spatial bin can be fit with a jump rate, $k_\mathrm{jump}(z)$.
  These are shown with a fit that provides a ``jump'' width,
  $j_\mathrm{10-90}$. The locations of the structural Gibbs dividing
  surfaces (using tetrahedrality) are indicated with vertical dashed
  blue lines, while the locations of the ``jump'' interfaces are shown in
  orange.}

  temperature for this model increases the observed liquid-state jump
  rates, and has brought the structural and jump interfaces much
  closer together.}
