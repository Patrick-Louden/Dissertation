In Chapter \ref{chap:Str}, the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface
was characterized by structural order parameters, and estimates of the
interfacial width were obtained by determining the distance over which
these parameters transitioned from their bulk liquid values to those
for ice-like configurations. The local density and tetrahedral order
parameters were found to transition smoothly between the two regions,
and yield similar widths for a given facet.  It is well known that the
dynamics of water molecules depend not only on their local structure
and environment, but also on the ordering of molecules outside of
their first solvation shell. Given this, we also expect the dynamics of the
water molecules to change as we traverse from the solid to the
liquid.

\section{Diffusion Coefficients as a Measure of Interfacial Width}
As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:intro}, transport coefficients can
be defined by relating a system's response to an external
perturbation. For example, the diffusion coefficient can be expressed
in terms of an applied particle or momentum flux and the resulting
concentration gradient; just as the shear viscosity can be expressed
in terms of an applied shear stress and the resulting velocity
gradient. In general, it is also possible to obtain transport
coefficients ($\gamma$) from an infinite time integral of an
equilibrium time correlation function of a related flux
($\mathscr{\dot{A}}$).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transport1}
\gamma = \int_0^{\infty} dt \langle \dot{\mathscr{A}}(t)
\dot{\mathscr{A}}(0)\rangle 
\end{equation}
Albert Einstein was able to show that for any expression written in
this form, there is an associated expression,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transport2}
2t\gamma = \langle (\mathscr{A}(t)-\mathscr{A}(0))^2 \rangle
\end{equation}
for large $t$ compared to the correlation time of $\mathscr{A}$. 

For example, the diffusion coefficient $D$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diffusion1}
D = \frac{1}{3} \int_0^{\infty} dt \langle \dot{\mathbf{r}_i}(t) 
\dot{\mathbf{r}_i}(0) \rangle
\end{equation}
where $\dot{\mathbf{r}_i}(t)$ is the center-of-mass velocity of molecule
$i$, and the factor of $\frac{1}{3}$ accounts for motion in three
dimensions. From Equation \eqref{eq:transport1} and Equation \eqref{eq:transport2},
the corresponding Einstein relation is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diffusion2}
2Dt = \frac{1}{3} \langle | \mathbf{r}_i(t) - \mathbf{r}_i(0) |^2 \rangle
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{r}_i(t)$ is the center-of-mass position of molecule
$i$. 

The spatially-resolved three-dimensional diffusion constant,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diffusion3}
D(z) = \frac{1}{6t} \langle | \mathbf{r}_i(t) - \mathbf{r}_i(0) |^2
\delta(z_i(0) - z)  \rangle 
\end{equation}
provides local information about the translational motions available to
water molecules initially located in a finite width slab, $\delta
z$. Here, the angle brackets indicate an average over all the water
molecules and time origins available from the simulation. In the
liquid, translation primarily occurs on two separate time scales. At
short times, diffusion occurs within local solvation cages, while at
longer times molecules leave their solvation shells and form new cage
conformations. Comparatively, translational diffusion within the ice
is nonexistent. Therefore, we expect the corresponding diffusion
constants for these two regions to be vastly different. Observing the
spatial length over which this transition occurs provides us with a
dynamic width of the interface, and allows for comparison with the
structural widths obtained in Chapter \ref{chap:Str}.

For each of the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interfaces described in
Chapter \ref{chap:Methods}, four one nanosecond simulations were
performed without the presence of an applied kinetic energy or
momentum flux (\textit{i.e.}, no thermal or velocity gradient was
present in the system). Configurations of the systems were stored
every 100 fs, and spatially resolved three-dimensional diffusion
coefficients were computed by slicing the systems into 1~\AA~bins
along the $z$-dimension and computing $D(z)$ for molecules initially
within these bins. (see Figure \ref{fig:DzSPCE} and Figure
\ref{fig:DzTIP4PIce}).

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/DzSPCE}
\caption{\label{fig:DzSPCE} Upper: Mean-squared displacement (MSD)
  collected in 1 \AA~bins across the SPC/E basal ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
  water interface. The band with no increase in the MSD are the water
  molecules in the ice, while the band that increases most quickly
  corresponds to bins in the liquid. Between these two bands are bins
  which span the interfacial liquid water, with a MSD which increases
  moderately in time. Lower: The spatially resolved three-dimensional
  diffusion coefficient, $D(z)$, can be obtained from fitting the MSD
  data by Equation \eqref{eq:diffusion3}. These are shown along with a fit
  that provides a ``diffusion'' width, $d_{10-90}^{D}$. The locations
  of the structural Gibbs dividing surfaces (using tetrahedrality) are
  indicated with vertical dashed blue lines, while the locations of
  the ``diffusion'' interfaces are shown in green.  }
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/DzTIP4PIce}
\caption{\label{fig:DzTIP4PIce} The same basal diffusion coefficients
  as Figure \ref{fig:DzSPCE}, but collected using the TIP4P/Ice model
  and at 270 K. Note that the higher coexistence temperature for this
  model increases the observed diffusion coefficients, and has brought
  the structural and diffusion interfaces closer together.}
\end{figure*}

In the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:DzSPCE} and Figure
\ref{fig:DzTIP4PIce}, the mean-squared displacement (MSD:
$\langle | \mathbf{r}_i(t) - \mathbf{r}_i(0) |^2 \rangle $) has been
computed across the basal ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface. At
early times, the MSD rises parabolically due to the ballistic motion
of molecules; \textit{i.e.}, the pre-collision motion of molecules
within their local solvation cages. At slightly longer times, the
molecules bounce off of their solvation cages, which can be seen in
the crossover in the MSD immediately following the ballistic
regime. Diffusion coefficients are obtained from a linear regression
of the longer time portion of the MSDs using Equation
\eqref{eq:diffusion3}, and are shown in the lower panels of the same
figures. Calculation of the diffusion coefficients was performed
assuming the water molecules can translate in three dimensions, even
though it may be more appropriate to assume motion in only two
dimensions for molecules close to the ice.

In the bulk liquid portions of the SPC/E system (lower panel of
Figure \ref{fig:DzSPCE}), diffusion coefficients are found to be
$\sim$~0.75$\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{m}^{2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1 }$, while in
the ice the transport coefficient is numerically zero. In comparison,
diffusion constants for the liquid region of the systems modeled with
the TIP4P/Ice forcefield were found to be
$\sim$~1.75$\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{m}^{2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1 }$ (lower
panel of Figure \ref{fig:DzTIP4PIce}). The observed increase in the
reported values is attributed to the warmer temperature of the
liquid. We can determine the distance over which this transition
occurs by fitting the $D(z)$ profiles with a function designed to
smoothly transition from the liquid to the ice.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Dfit}
  D(z) = \frac{1}{D_\mathrm{liquid}} - \frac{1}{2D_\mathrm{liquid}} \left(
      \tanh \left( \frac{z-l}{d^D} \right) - \tanh \left( \frac{z-r}{d^D} \right) \right)
\end{equation}
  
Here, $D_\mathrm{liquid}$ is the value of the diffusion coefficient in
the liquid, $l$ and $r$ are the Gibbs dividing surface of the left and
right interfaces (indicated with vertical green lines in Figure
\ref{fig:DzSPCE} and Figure \ref{fig:DzTIP4PIce}), and $d^{D}$ is the
width of the interface. These values of interfacial width are related
to the structural $10\%-90\%$ interfacial widths reported in Chapter
\ref{chap:Str} by the same scaling coefficient,
($d_\mathrm{10-90}^{D} = 2.197~d^{D}$). All four SPC/E interfaces
exhibit dynamic widths of $\sim$~14~\AA~, which is significantly
larger than the widths predicted by structural measurements reported
in Table \ref{tab:strWidths}. Similarly, the TIP4P/Ice systems at
270~K exhibit dynamic widths of $\sim$12~\AA~, which are also larger
than the interfacial widths predicted by structural measures for the
same model. Surprisingly, the TIP4P/Ice model at 270~K predicts a
narrower interface than the SPC/E model at 225~K. This could indicate
that at the warmer temperature, the liquid molecules near the surface
recover their bulk-like dynamics over fewer molecular layers advancing
from the ice. However, the associated error with these measurements is
rather large and precise values cannot be definitively
established. The dynamic widths for each interface,
$d_\mathrm{10-90}^{D}$, are reported in Table \ref{tab:dynWidths}.

It is interesting to note that the two Gibbs dividing surfaces
(tetrahedrality in blue, diffusion in green) shown in the lower panels
of Figure \ref{fig:DzSPCE} and Figure \ref{fig:DzTIP4PIce} are not the
same. The SPC/E systems exhibit a wide separation between these two
interfaces, $\sim$~8 \AA~, while the TIP4P/Ice model predicts a much
narrower separation $\sim$~4 \AA~. Due to the dependence of molecular
motion on the first ($\sim$~4 \AA) and second ($\sim$~7 \AA) solvation
shells, it is not clear \textit{a priori} if these two interfaces
should lie on top of one another. While structural ordering of the
interfacial liquid may become bulk-like after a few molecular
diameters, the dynamics of molecules may be influenced further out
into the bulk. However, this discrepancy between the spatial
separations of the Gibbs dividing surfaces for structural and dynamic
measures appears to be robust, as evident in the following sections of
this chapter.

\section{Reorientation of Water Molecules}
The spatially-resolved orientational time correlation function,
\begin{equation}\label{C(t)1}
  C_{2}(z,t)=\langle P_{2}(\mathbf{u}_i(0)\cdot \mathbf{u}_i(t))
  \delta(z_i(0) - z) \rangle,
\end{equation}
provides local information about the decorrelation of molecular
orientations in time. Here, $P_{2}$ is the second-order Legendre
polynomial, and $\mathbf{u}_i$ is the molecular unit vector that
bisects the HOH angle of molecule $i$. Again, the angle brackets
indicate an average over all the water molecules and time origins, and
the delta function restricts the average to specific regions in the
$z$-dimension.

In the ice crystal, decay of $C_2(z,t)$ is incomplete, while in the
liquid, correlation times are typically measured in ps. Observing the
spatial transition between the decay regimes can define another
dynamic measure of the interfacial width. To determine dynamic widths
of the interfaces under shear, each of the systems were divided into
bins along the $z$ axis ($\approx$ 1 \AA\ wide) and $C_2(z,t)$ was
computed using only those molecules that were in the bin at the
initial time (see Figure \ref{fig:Czt}). For each ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
water interface investigated, four repetitions of the following 0.5 ns
simulations were computed: quiescent simulations (where no thermal or
momentum gradient was present), simulations with only a thermal
gradient present, and simulations where both thermal and momentum
gradients were present. During these simulations, the positions and
orientations of each molecule were recorded every 100 fs.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/CztImage}
\caption{\label{fig:Czt}~$C_2(z,t)$ collected in 1 \AA~bins across the SPC/E
  secondary prism ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface. The band that experiences very
  little decay represents water molecules in the ice, while the band
  that decays quickly corresponds to bins in the liquid.  The
  correlation function presents a continuous distribution of decay
  behaviors across the interface between ice and liquid water.}
\end{figure*}

Recently, Laage and Hynes have determined the mechanism for water
reorientation.~\cite{Laage2006,Laage2008} Using molecular dynamics
simulations, they found that water reorients by breaking a hydrogen
bond with an overcoordinated first-shell neighbor, and makes a large
angle jump to form a new hydrogen bond with an undercoordinated
second-shell neighbor. The hydrogen bond cleavage and molecular
reorientation occur in a concerted fashion, not in successive steps as
was previously thought. With this detailed picture, they constructed
the Extended Jump Model\cite{Laage2006,Laage2008} based on the Ivanov
Jump Model and parameters extracted from their molecular simulations;
the average jump amplitude of the rotational jump, $\theta_{0}$, and
the frequency of the jumps, $1/\tau_{0}$. After accounting for
molecular frame reorientation, the Extended Jump Model is able to
predict reorientation relaxation times, $\tau_{n}^{jump}$, which agree
with experimental results as well as estimates obtained from
simulations where fast librational motion is ignored.

Computed $C_2(z,t)$ values have previously been fit to a
triexponential decay, with three time constants:
$\tau_\mathrm{short}$, measuring the librational motion of the water
molecules, $\tau_\mathrm{middle}$, measuring the timescale for the
large angle jumps during the breaking and making of hydrogen bonds,
and $\tau_\mathrm{long}$, corresponding to the translational motion of
the water molecules.\cite{Louden2013a} The Extended Jump Model also
includes three similar decay constants, however two of them are linked
and the dynamics of the decay is governed by two parameters. Since we
are interested in how the decay times and the individual contributions
may change through the interface, we have fit the $C_2(z,t)$ data
with
\begin{equation}
  C_{2}(z,t) = a~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{short}} + b~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{middle}} + 
  (1-a-b)~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{long}}
\label{eq:c2}
\end{equation}
where all of the decay constants are considered local functions of the
$z$ coordinate. In Figure \ref{fig:SPorient}, the $z$-coordinate
profiles for the three decay constants, $\tau_{\mathrm{short}}$,
$\tau_{\mathrm{middle}}$, and $\tau_{\mathrm{long}}$ for the SPC/E
secondary prism interface is shown, along with their fractional
components of the overall total decay, ($a$, $b$, $1-a-b$),
respectively. Similar figures for the other SPC/E interfaces are provided in
Appendix \ref{dynamicAppendix}.

In the liquid regions of all four interfaces, $\tau_\mathrm{middle}$
and $\tau_\mathrm{long}$ consistently approach $3-6$ ps and $30-40$
ps, respectively.  Both of these times increase closer to the local
tetrahedral order parameter interface.  Conversely,
$\tau_\mathrm{short}$ decreases from a liquid-state value of $72-76$
fs approaching the same interface.

The fractional contributions of the three motions to the overall decay
changes as we approach the interface as well. Far from the ice, the
librational motion and hydrogen bond breaking/making events each
contribute to about 20 percent of the total decay, whereas frame
reorientation contributes about 60 percent. As we approach the
interface, the librations and hydrogen bond dynamics both decrease in
contribution. The librations comprise approximately 15 percent of the
overall decay at the edge of the interface, whereas the hydrogen bond
contributions drop to approximately zero. In contrast, the fraction of
the total decay due to frame reorientation is shown to increase
approaching the interface.  The time constant corresponding to this
motion is seen to logarithmically increase as we approach the interface
as the molecules become more ice-like. In the ice we would expect
molecular reorientation to be incomplete, however, at the interface we
observe frame reorientation to contribute 85 percent of the overall
decay.

  SPC/E secondary prism interface, and their fractional contributions to the

  constants are plotted as a function of distance from the center of
  the ice slab. The vertical dashed line indicates the Gibbs dividing
  surface determined using the local tetrahedral order parameter.
  Results are shown for a quiescent system with no applied kinetic or
  momentum flux (black), an interface with an imposed
  kinetic energy flux (red), and a sheared simulation (blue) with both
  kinetic and momentum fluxes.}
\end{figure*}

The middle and long decay times diverge inside the ice crystal, so the
orientational rate, $k(z) = 1 / \tau(z)$ can be used to identify a
dynamic interfacial width for the interface by fitting the profiles of
the middle and long-time orientational rates with a function that goes
smoothly between bulk-like liquid behavior and the crystal,
\begin{equation}\label{tauFit}
  k(z) = \frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{liquid}} - \frac{1}{2~\tau_\mathrm{liquid}} \left(
      \tanh \left( \frac{z-l}{d^{C_2}} \right) - \tanh \left( \frac{z-r}{d^{C_2}} \right) \right)
\end{equation}
where $l$ and $r$ are the locations of the Gibbs dividing surfaces,
and $d^{C_2}$ is a dynamic width.  As with the structural widths,
$10\%-90\%$ dynamic widths are easily computed from the fits
($d_\mathrm{10-90}^{C_2} = 2.197~d^{C_2}$), and are provided in Table
\ref{tab:dynWidths}. All four SPC/E interfaces exhibit dynamic widths
that are $\sim 11$~\AA, and are larger than the structural widths
reported in Table \ref{tab:strWidths}.  In TIP4P/Ice at 270K, the dynamic widths are
$\sim 14$~\AA, also larger than the structural widths reported in the
same table.
 
\section{Spatial Resolution of Hydrogen Bond Jump Rates}
The spatially-resolved hydrogen bond jump correlation function,
\begin{equation}\label{jump}
C_\mathrm{jump}(z,t) = 1 - \langle n_a(0) n_b(t) \delta(z_i(0) - z) \rangle
\end{equation}
measures the decorrelation of a hydrogen bond on molecule $i$ as it
transitions between one acceptor ($a$) and another ($b$). $n_a(0)$ is
set to one if hydrogen $i$ is bound to acceptor $a$ at time $0$, and
is zero otherwise.  Absorbing boundaries are utilized with this
correlation function; switches from $b$ back to $a$ at a later time
are considered a new jump, and the angle brackets indicate an average
over all donor hydrogens and time origins. Laage and Hynes determined
the bulk version of this function had \textit{single}-exponential
decay in room temperature water.

A version of this correlation function was used to investigate how
water molecules reorient around
ions\cite{Laage2007,Laage2008a,Stirnemann2011a,Laage2011},
proteins\cite{Duboue-Dijon2014}, and in confined
spaces\cite{Laage2012b,Fogarty2014}.  Laage and Hynes studied how the
strength of the hydrogen bond might perturb the reorientation
dynamics,\cite{Laage2006a} and found the librational motion which
forms a cone around the O-O vector is smaller for more strongly
hydrogen bonded water. This may also provide a partial explanation for
the increasing contribution of short time orientational decay very
close to the ice surfaces.  Since the solid creates an excluded volume
for the water molecules that are in proximity to the interface, the
hindered range of motion (i.e., a smaller cone around the O-O vector)
manifests as faster librational decay.

As a third measure of a dynamic width of the quiescent
interfaces, each of the systems were divided into bins along the $z$
axis ($\approx$ 1 \AA\ wide) and $C_\mathrm{jump}(z,t)$ was computed
(see top panels of Figure \ref{fig:SPkjmp} and Figure
\ref{fig:SPTIP4Pkjmp}).  Like Laage and Hynes, we find that within
each spatial region, the decay is easily fit with a single
exponential, yielding a local hydrogen bond jump time. The jump times
diverge inside the ice crystal, so the jump rate,
$k_\mathrm{jump}(z) = 1 / \tau_0(z)$ can be used to identify a
hydrogen bond jump width for the interface in a similar manner to the
orientational decay rates (see lower panels of Figure \ref{fig:SPkjmp} and Figure
\ref{fig:SPTIP4Pkjmp}). $k_\mathrm{jump}(z)$ was fit with a hyperbolic
tangent (see Equation \eqref{tauFit}) and the $10\%-90\%$ jump width,
$d_\mathrm{10-90}^{jump}$, is reported in Table \ref{tab:dynWidths}.

We observe jump widths which agree well with the other dynamic
measures presented in this chapter. Again, no apparent trend is observed for
interfacial thickness with presented crystal facet. Here, the SPC/E
and TIP4P/Ice models agree reasonably well, as each interface is
$\sim$~11 \AA~wide. The 14\degree~pyramidal interfacial width modeled
by TIP4P/Ice is slightly smaller than the other interfaces.

In the lower panels of Figure \ref{fig:SPkjmp} and Figure
\ref{fig:SPTIP4Pkjmp}, the hydrogen-bond jump rate is plotted across
the interface. The vertical dashed blue lines indicate the midpoint of
the interface as determined by the local tetrahedral order parameter,
while the midpoint for the jump interface is shown in solid orange
lines. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:DzSPCE} and Figure
\ref{fig:DzTIP4PIce}, there is closer agreement between the locations
of the dynamic and structural interfaces with the TIP4P/Ice model as
compared with the SPC/E model. Here, the discrepancy is $\sim$~ 3~\AA~
for the SPC/E model and $\sim$~ 1~\AA~ for the TIP4P/Ice model. It is
still unclear if the structural and dynamical interface comes into
alignment due to the warmer temperature, or if is due to a difference
in the model parameters, however, the trend seems robust.

  while the band that decays quickly corresponds to bins in the

\section{Discussion}
The primary results presented in this chapter are the characterization
of the dynamics of water molecules across ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water
interfaces. This was accomplished by computing three separate order
parameters for small slabs perpendicular to the presented ice
surface. Quantifying the spatial transition between the bulk liquid
and bulk ice regimes gives an estimate of dynamic interfacial
width. These widths were found to be slightly larger than those based
on structural measures reported in Chapter \ref{chap:Str}. However, as
we found with the local tetrahedral order parameter, the computed
orientational dynamic widths are invariant to shear rate and shear
direction relative to the surface features of the ice.

Following Haymet \textit{et al.}, the three-dimension diffusion
coefficient was used to investigate quiescent ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
water
interfaces. \cite{Karim1987,Karim1988,Hayward2001,Bryk2002,Hayward2002}
Karim \textit{et al.} estimated the basal ice / water interface to be
three to four molecular diameters wide ($\sim$10~-~15 \AA~) with the
TIP4P model at 240~K.\cite{Karim1987,Karim1988} Similarly, Bryk and
Haymet explored the SPC/E basal and prismatic ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
water interface.\cite{Bryk2002} At 230~K, they observed diffusion
coefficients across the interface that agree well with ours reported
in Figure \ref{fig:DzSPCE}. In the liquid, they computed $D$ to be
$\sim~(3.7 \pm 0.08) \times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{m}^{2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,
and in the ice they were unable to resolve a diffusion coefficient
from error. While these results are at a warmer temperature than the
coexistence temperature for this model (225~K), the computed results
agree well with our predictions at the slightly cooler solid-liquid
phase boundary. Hayward \textit{et al.} observed similar behavior with
the flexible CF1 model at 270~K, which predicted slightly narrower
interfaces for the 14\degree~ pyramidal and secondary prism compared
to the basal and prismatic interfaces.\cite{Hayward2001,Hayward2002}
Given that, all interfacial widths were determined to be $\sim$~10
\AA~ wide by fitting the diffusion coefficients by envelope
functions. Comparing our results reported in Table \ref{tab:dynWidths}
to those of Haymet \textit{et al.}, we see general agreement between
the wide variety of water models and simulation temperatures.

Using the TIP4P water model at 240~K, Nada \textit{et al.}  observed
different behavior for the diffusion of molecules at the basal and
prismatic ice / water interfaces.\cite{Nada1995} They found
significantly larger diffusion coefficients for the liquid solvating
the basal crystal face as compared to the prismatic; suggesting that
while the water at the basal interface has hindered diffusion due to
the supercooling of the liquid, interfacial water solvating the
prismatic face is hindered by the temperature and an addition effect
driven by the crystal surface. While we were unable to capture this
phenomena with either the SPC/E or TIP4P/Ice models, it suggests that
the underlying ice surface can significantly influence the dynamics of
molecules at the interface. This result will be confirmed and
extrapolated upon in Chapters \ref{chap:Friction} and 
\ref{chap:QLL}.

While it is still unclear if it is appropriate to assume
three-dimensional diffusion for liquid at the surface of ice, the
interfacial molecules for all studies discussed here (including our
own) were able to exchange with molecules in the ice. That is, there
were no restraints on the water molecules comprising the ice
lattice. While this allowed for \textit{pseudo} three-dimensional
diffusion of liquid molecules at the interface, determining the
spatial transition for two- to three-dimensional diffusion may prove
helpful in further quantifying these interfaces in the future.

So far we have observed that the translational motion of interfacial
water molecules is significantly hindered due to the supercooled
temperature and from the templating of the exposed surface of the
crystal. However, several other modes of motion remain available to
liquid water molecules at the surface of ice; namely, the internal
vibrations of the bonds and bends, and the decorrelation of the
molecular frame. Due to computational expense, we have frozen out the
internal vibrations of the water molecules, locking the atoms and
bends into a rigid structure. However, observing the decorrelation of
the molecular frame can further illuminate the effects of the surface
templating on the solvating water molecules.

While we are not the first to investigate the reorientation of
molecules through the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface, our
quantification of an interfacial width is the first estimate of its
kind. Bryk and Haymet also calculated the orientational time
correlation function at the basal interface of SPC/E
water,\cite{Bryk2002} and observed the same qualitative trend through
the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface. However, their spatial and
temporal resolution was not sufficient to resolve a dynamic width of
the interface.

Lastly it is worth pointing out the similarities between the four
crystal facets studied here. The dynamic measures of interfacial width
are in relative agreement, as are the decay constants of the
orientational autocorrelation function at the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
water interfaces. In Figure \ref{fig:SPCEjumpRates} and Figure
\ref{fig:TIP4PIcejumpRates}, the hydrogen bond jump rates for all four
facets are plotted for the SPC/E and TIP4P/Ice models,
respectively. For the SPC/E systems, we observe a jump rate of $\sim$
0.01 $\mathrm{ps}^{-1}$~ at each of the interfaces, and $\sim$ 0.02
$\mathrm{ps}^{-1}$~ at the TIP4P/Ice interfaces. The results presented
in Chapter \ref{chap:Str} and Chapter \ref{chap:Dyn} indicate that the
structure and dynamics of the liquid solvating the ice crystals is
insensitive to the presented crystal facet. However, as we will see in
Chapter \ref{chap:Friction} and Chapter \ref{chap:QLL}, this does not
capture \textit{all} of the hydrodynamic effects of the interface.


\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we have presented dynamic ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water
interfacial widths as evaluated by three separate order parameters. In
all three cases, the dynamic order parameters predict a much broader
interfacial width than either of the structural analyses described in
Chapter \ref{chap:Str}.  For SPC/E ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water
interfaces, the self diffusion coefficient gives an estimate of about
13 \AA~, while the TIP4P/Ice interface is found to be slightly
narrower, at about 12 \AA~ wide. These results agree well with
previously reported value, as well as the other two dynamic order
parameters investigated, the orientational time correlation function,
and the hydrogen bond jump time. However, the TIP4P/Ice model predicts
a slightly broader interface than the SPC/E model by the orientational
time correlation function, as well as the jump times.
