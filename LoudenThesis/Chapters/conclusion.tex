In summary, I have presented evidence and stuff.

Recently, Professor Mary Jane Schultz (sp) has developed a method for
obtaining ice crystals of presenting a single facet. Her method uses
competitve facet growth, where a single seed crystal is allowed to
grow in a large glass boule, but encounters a series of restricting
apatures which results in a single crystal face. FIX THAT.

In order to better validate my work presented here, it would be
interesting if Prof. Mary Jane Schultz's lab were to collaborate with
Kietzig and co. to do experiments of friciton on a single crystal
facet.
