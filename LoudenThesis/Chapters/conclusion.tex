In this dissertation I have presented an investigation of friction at
the surface of ice. Solid-liquid friction coefficients appropriate for
no-slip boundary conditions have been computed. Facet dependent
friction was observed, and explained in terms of the density of
solid-liquid hydrogen bonds. Interfacial molecules are characterized
by structural and dynamic methods, and interfacial widths are
estimated. 

A temperature dependent invetigation of the surface premelt at the
basal and prismatic surfaces of an ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ crystal is
presented. The quasi-liquid layer's width is found to depend on the
temperature, as are the structure and dynamics of the liquid-like
molecules. The shear viscosity of the premelt is determined by the
Stoke's Einstein relation. 

Recently, Professor Mary Jane Shultz has developed a method for
growing ice crystals presenting a single facet. Dr. Mary Kietzig has
extensive experience measuring friction coefficients at the surface of
ice. In order to validate my work presented here, it would be
interesting if Prof. Mary Jane Schultz were to collaborate with
Dr. Kietzig and measure friction coefficients for single facet
surfaces, as opposed to the poly-ice surfaces commonly measured
today.
