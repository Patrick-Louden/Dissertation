\chapter{The different facets of ice have different hydrophilicities: \\
  Friction at water / ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ interfaces}

  We present evidence that the prismatic and secondary prism facets of
  ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ crystals possess structural features that can
  reduce the effective hydrophilicity of the ice/water interface. The
  spreading dynamics of liquid water droplets on ice facets exhibits
  long-time behavior that differs for the prismatic
  $\{10\bar{1}0\}$ and secondary prism $\{11\bar{2}0\}$ facets
  when compared with the basal $\{0001\}$ and pyramidal
  $\{20\bar{2}1\}$ facets.  We also present the results of
  simulations of solid-liquid friction of the same four crystal facets
  being drawn through liquid water, and find that the two prismatic
  facets exhibit roughly half the solid-liquid friction of the basal
  and pyramidal facets.  These simulations provide evidence that the
  two prismatic faces have a significantly smaller effective surface
  area in contact with the liquid water. The ice / water interfacial
  widths for all four crystal facets are similar (using both
  structural and dynamic measures), and were found to be independent
  of the shear rate.  Additionally, decomposition of orientational
  time correlation functions show position-dependence for the short-
  and longer-time decay components close to the interface.

\section{Introduction}
Surfaces can be characterized as hydrophobic or hydrophilic
based on the strength of the interactions with water. Hydrophobic
surfaces do not have strong enough interactions with water to overcome
the internal attraction between molecules in the liquid phase, and the
degree of hydrophilicity of a surface can be described by the extent a
droplet can spread out over the surface. The contact angle, $\theta$,
formed between the solid and the liquid depends on the free energies
of the three interfaces involved, and is given by Young's
equation~\cite{Young2005},
\begin{equation}\label{young}
\cos\theta = (\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})/\gamma_{lv} .
\end{equation} 
Here $\gamma_{sv}$, $\gamma_{sl}$, and $\gamma_{lv}$ are the free
energies of the solid/vapor, solid/liquid, and liquid/vapor interfaces,
respectively.  Large contact angles, $\theta > 90^{\circ}$, correspond
to hydrophobic surfaces with low wettability, while small contact
angles, $\theta < 90^{\circ}$, correspond to hydrophilic surfaces.
Experimentally, measurements of the contact angle of sessile drops is
often used to quantify the extent of wetting on surfaces with
thermally selective wetting
characteristics~\cite{Tadanaga2000,Liu2004,Sun2004}.

Nanometer-scale structural features of a solid surface can influence
the hydrophilicity to a surprising degree.  Small changes in the
heights and widths of nano-pillars can change a surface from
superhydrophobic, $\theta \ge 150^{\circ}$, to hydrophilic, $\theta
\sim 0^{\circ}$~\cite{Koishi2009}. This is often referred to as the
Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel transition.  Nano-pillared surfaces with
electrically tunable Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states have also been
observed~\cite{Herbertson2006,Dhindsa2006,Verplanck2007,Ahuja2008,Manukyan2011}.
Luzar and coworkers have modeled these transitions on nano-patterned
surfaces~\cite{Daub2007,Daub2010,Daub2011,Ritchie2012}, and have found the
change in contact angle is due to the field-induced perturbation of
hydrogen bonding at the liquid/vapor interface~\cite{Daub2007}.

One would expect the interfaces of ice to be highly hydrophilic (and
possibly the most hydrophilic of all solid surfaces). In this paper we
present evidence that some of the crystal facets of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$
have structural features that can reduce the effective hydrophilicity.
Our evidence for this comes from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of the spreading dynamics of liquid droplets on these facets, as well
as reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) simulations of
solid-liquid friction.

Quiescent ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water interfaces have been studied
extensively using computer simulations. Hayward and Haymet
characterized and measured the widths of these
interfaces~\cite{Hayward2001,Hayward2002}.  Nada and Furukawa have also
modeled the width of basal/water and prismatic/water
interfaces~\cite{Nada1995} as well as crystal restructuring at
temperatures approaching the melting point~\cite{Nada2000}.

The surface of ice exhibits a pre-melting layer, often called a
quasi-liquid layer (QLL), at temperatures near the melting point.  MD
simulations of the facets of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ exposed to vacuum have
found QLL widths of approximately 10 \AA\ at 3 K below the melting
point~\cite{Conde2008}. Similarly, Limmer and Chandler have used the mW
water model~\cite{Molinero2009} and statistical field theory to estimate
QLL widths at similar temperatures to be about 3 nm~\cite{Limmer2014}.

Recently, Sazaki and Furukawa have developed a technique using laser
confocal microscopy combined with differential interference contrast
microscopy that has sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to
visualize and quantitatively analyze QLLs on ice crystals at
temperatures near melting~\cite{Sazaki2010}. They have found the width of
the QLLs perpendicular to the surface at -2.2$^{o}$C to be 3-4 \AA\
wide.  They have also seen the formation of two immiscible QLLs, which
displayed different dynamics on the crystal surface~\cite{Sazaki2012}.

% There is now significant interest in the \textit{tribological}
% properties of ice/ice and ice/water interfaces in the geophysics
% community.  Understanding the dynamics of solid-solid shearing that is
% mediated by a liquid layer~\cite{Cuffey99, Bell08} will aid in
% understanding the macroscopic motion of large ice
% masses~\cite{Casassa91, Sukhorukov13, Pritchard12, Lishman13}.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, Samadashvili has recently shown
that when two smooth ice slabs slide past one another, a stable
liquid-like layer develops between them~\cite{Samadashvili2013}. In a
previous study, our RNEMD simulations of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ shearing
through liquid water have provided quantitative estimates of the
solid-liquid kinetic friction coefficients~\cite{Louden2013a}. These
displayed a factor of two difference between the basal and prismatic
facets.  The friction was found to be independent of shear direction
relative to the surface orientation.  We attributed facet-based
difference in liquid-solid friction to the 6.5 \AA\ corrugation of the
prismatic face which reduces the effective surface area of the ice
that is in direct contact with liquid water.

In the sections that follow, we describe the simulations of
droplet-spreading dynamics using standard MD as well as simulations of
tribological properties using RNEMD.  These simulations give
complementary results that point to the prismatic and secondary prism
facets having roughly half of their surface area in direct contact
with the liquid.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Construction of the Ice / Water interfaces}
% Ice I$_\mathrm{h}$ crystallizes in the hexagonal space group
% P$6_3/mmc$, and common ice crystals form hexagonal plates with the
% basal face, $\{0001\}$, forming the top and bottom of each plate, and
% the prismatic facet, $\{10\bar{1}0\}$, forming the sides.  In extreme
% temperatures or low water saturation conditions, ice crystals can
% easily form as hollow columns, needles and dendrites. These are
% structures that expose other crystalline facets of the ice to the
% surroundings.  Among the more common facets are the secondary prism,
% $\{11\bar{2}0\}$, and pyramidal, $\{20\bar{2}1\}$, faces.  

% We found it most useful to work with proton-ordered, zero-dipole
% crystals that expose strips of dangling H-atoms and lone
% pairs~\cite{Buch:2008fk}.  Our structures were created starting from
% Structure 6 of Hirsch and Ojam\"{a}e's set of orthorhombic
% representations for ice-I$_{h}$~\cite{Hirsch04}.  This crystal
% structure was cleaved along the four different facets.  The exposed
% face was reoriented normal to the $z$-axis of the simulation cell, and
% the structures were extended to form large exposed facets in
% rectangular box geometries.  Liquid water boxes were created with
% identical dimensions (in $x$ and $y$) as the ice, with a $z$ dimension
% of three times that of the ice block, and a density corresponding to 1
% g / cm$^3$.  Each of the ice slabs and water boxes were independently
% equilibrated at a pressure of 1 atm, and the resulting systems were
% merged by carving out any liquid water molecules within 3 \AA\ of any
% atoms in the ice slabs.  Each of the combined ice/water systems were
% then equilibrated at 225K, which is the liquid-ice coexistence
% temperature for SPC/E water~\cite{Bryk02}. Reference
% \citealp{Louden13} contains a more detailed explanation of the
% construction of similar ice/water interfaces. The resulting dimensions
% as well as the number of ice and liquid water molecules contained in
% each of these systems are shown in Table \ref{tab:method}.

% The SPC/E water model~\cite{Berendsen87} has been extensively
% characterized over a wide range of liquid
% conditions~\cite{Arbuckle02,Kuang12}, and its phase diagram has been
% well studied~\cite{Baez95,Bryk04b,Sanz04b,Fennell:2005fk}. With longer
% cutoff radii and careful treatment of electrostatics, SPC/E mostly
% avoids metastable crystalline morphologies like
% ice-\textit{i}~\cite{Fennell:2005fk} and ice-B~\cite{Baez95}.  The
% free energies and melting
% points~\cite{Baez95,Arbuckle02,Gay02,Bryk02,Bryk04b,Sanz04b,Fennell:2005fk,Fernandez06,Abascal07,Vrbka07}
% of various other crystalline polymorphs have also been calculated.
% Haymet \textit{et al.} have studied quiescent Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water
% interfaces using the SPC/E water model, and have seen structural and
% dynamic measurements of the interfacial width that agree well with
% more expensive water models, although the coexistence temperature for
% SPC/E is still well below the experimental melting point of real
% water~\cite{Bryk02}. Given the extensive data and speed of this model,
% it is a reasonable choice even though the temperatures required are
% somewhat lower than real ice / water interfaces.

\section{Droplet Simulations}
Ice surfaces with a thickness of $\sim$~20~\AA\ were created as
described above, but were not solvated in a liquid box. The crystals
were then replicated along the $x$ and $y$ axes (parallel to the
surface) until a large surface ($>$ 126 nm\textsuperscript{2}) had
been created.  The sizes and numbers of molecules in each of the
surfaces is given in Table S1.  Weak translational restraining
potentials with spring constants of 1.5~$\mathrm{kcal\
  mol}^{-1}\mathrm{~\AA}^{-2}$ (prismatic and pyramidal facets) or
4.0~$\mathrm{kcal\ mol}^{-1}\mathrm{~\AA}^{-2}$ (basal facet) were
applied to the centers of mass of each molecule in order to prevent
surface melting, although the molecules were allowed to reorient
freely. A water droplet containing 2048 SPC/E molecules was created
separately. Droplets of this size can produce agreement with the Young
contact angle extrapolated to an infinite drop size~\cite{Daub2010}. The
surfaces and droplet were independently equilibrated to 225~K, at
which time the droplet was placed 3-5~\AA\ above the surface.  Five
statistically independent simulations were carried out for each facet,
and the droplet was placed at unique $x$ and $y$ locations for each of
these simulations.  Each simulation was 5~ns in length and was
conducted in the microcanonical (NVE) ensemble.  Representative
configurations for the droplet on the prismatic facet are shown in
figure \ref{fig:Droplet}.

% \section{Shearing Simulations (Interfaces in Bulk Water)}
% To perform the shearing simulations, the velocity shearing and scaling
% variant of reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (VSS-RNEMD) was
% employed \cite{Kuang12}. This method performs a series of simultaneous
% non-equilibrium exchanges of linear momentum and kinetic energy
% between two physically-separated regions of the simulation cell.  The
% system responds to this unphysical flux with velocity and temperature
% gradients.  When VSS-RNEMD is applied to bulk liquids, transport
% properties like the thermal conductivity and the shear viscosity are
% easily extracted assuming a linear response between the flux and the
% gradient.  At the interfaces between dissimilar materials, the same
% method can be used to extract \textit{interfacial} transport
% properties (e.g. the interfacial thermal conductance and the
% hydrodynamic slip length).

% The kinetic energy flux (producing a thermal gradient) is necessary
% when performing shearing simulations at the ice-water interface in
% order to prevent the frictional heating due to the shear from melting
% the crystal. Reference \citealp{Louden13} provides more details on the
% VSS-RNEMD method as applied to ice-water interfaces. A representative
% configuration of the solvated prismatic facet being sheared through
% liquid water is shown in figure \ref{fig:Shearing}.

% All simulations were performed using OpenMD~\cite{OOPSE,openmd}, with
% a time step of 2 fs and periodic boundary conditions in all three
% dimensions.  Electrostatics were handled using the damped-shifted
% force real-space electrostatic kernel~\cite{Ewald}. 

% The interfaces were equilibrated for a total of 10 ns at equilibrium
% conditions before being exposed to either a shear or thermal gradient.
% This consisted of 5 ns under a constant temperature (NVT) integrator
% set to 225~K followed by 5 ns under a microcanonical (NVE) integrator.
% Weak thermal gradients were allowed to develop using the VSS-RNEMD
% (NVE) integrator using a small thermal flux ($-2.0\times 10^{-6}$
% kcal/mol/\AA$^2$/fs) for a duration of 5 ns to allow the gradient to
% stabilize.  The resulting temperature gradient was $\approx$ 10K over
% the entire box length, which was sufficient to keep the temperature at
% the interface within $\pm 1$ K of the 225~K target.

% Velocity gradients were then imposed using the VSS-RNEMD (NVE)
% integrator with a range of momentum fluxes.  The systems were divided
% into 100 bins along the $z$-axis for the VSS-RNEMD moves, which were
% attempted every time step.  Although computationally expensive, this
% was done to minimize the magnitude of each individual momentum
% exchange.  Because individual VSS-RNEMD exchange moves conserve both
% total energy and linear momentum, the method can be ``bolted-on'' to
% simulations in any ensemble.  The simulations of the pyramidal
% interface were performed under the canonical (NVT) ensemble.  When
% time correlation functions were computed, the RNEMD simulations were
% done in the microcanonical (NVE) ensemble.  All simulations of the
% other interfaces were carried out in the microcanonical ensemble.

% These gradients were allowed to stabilize for 1~ns before data
% collection started. Once established, four successive 0.5~ns runs were
% performed for each shear rate.  During these simulations,
% configurations of the system were stored every 1~ps, and statistics on
% the structure and dynamics in each bin were accumulated throughout the
% simulations.  Although there was some small variation in the measured
% interfacial width between succcessive runs, no indication of bulk
% melting or crystallization was observed.  That is, no large scale
% changes in the positions of the top and bottom interfaces occurred
% during the simulations.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Ice - Water Contact Angles}
To determine the extent of wetting for each of the four crystal
facets, contact angles for liquid droplets on the ice surfaces were
computed using two methods.  In the first method, the droplet is
assumed to form a spherical cap, and the contact angle is estimated
from the $z$-axis location of the droplet's center of mass
($z_\mathrm{cm}$).  This procedure was first described by Hautman and
Klein~\cite{Hautman1991}, and was utilized by Hirvi and Pakkanen in
their investigation of water droplets on polyethylene and poly(vinyl
chloride) surfaces~\cite{Hirvi2006}. For each stored configuration, the
contact angle, $\theta$, was found by inverting the expression for the
location of the droplet center of mass,
\begin{equation}\label{contact_1}
\langle z_\mathrm{cm}\rangle = 2^{-4/3}R_{0}\bigg(\frac{1-cos\theta}{2+cos\theta}\bigg)^{1/3}\frac{3+cos\theta}{2+cos\theta} ,
\end{equation}
where $R_{0}$ is the radius of the free water droplet. 

In addition to the spherical cap method outlined above, a second
method for obtaining the contact angle was described by Ruijter,
Blake, and Coninck~\cite{Ruijter1999}.  This method uses a cylindrical
averaging of the droplet's density profile.  A threshold density of
0.5 g cm\textsuperscript{-3} is used to estimate the location of the
edge of the droplet.  The $r$ and $z$-dependence of the droplet's edge
is then fit to a circle, and the contact angle is computed from the
intersection of the fit circle with the $z$-axis location of the solid
surface.  Again, for each stored configuration, the density profile in
a set of annular shells was computed. Due to large density
fluctuations close to the ice, all shells located within 2 \AA\ of the
ice surface were left out of the circular fits.  The height of the
solid surface ($z_\mathrm{suface}$) along with the best fitting origin
($z_\mathrm{droplet}$) and radius ($r_\mathrm{droplet}$) of the
droplet can then be used to compute the contact angle,
\begin{equation}
\theta =  90 + \frac{180}{\pi} \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{z_\mathrm{droplet} -
  z_\mathrm{surface}}{r_\mathrm{droplet}} \right).
\end{equation}
Both methods provided similar estimates of the dynamic contact angle,
although the spherical cap method is significantly less prone to
noise, and is the method used to compute the contact angles in table
\ref{tab:kappa}.

Because the initial droplet was placed above the surface, the initial
value of 180$^{\circ}$ decayed over time (See figure 1 in the
SI).  Each of these profiles were fit to a
biexponential decay, with a short-time contribution ($\tau_c$) that
describes the initial contact with the surface, a long time
contribution ($\tau_s$) that describes the spread of the droplet over
the surface, and a constant ($\theta_\infty$) to capture the
infinite-time estimate of the equilibrium contact angle,
\begin{equation}
\theta(t) = \theta_\infty +  (180-\theta_\infty) \left[ a e^{-t/\tau_c} +
  (1-a) e^{-t/\tau_s}  \right]
\end{equation}
We have found that the rate for water droplet spreading across all
four crystal facets, $k_\mathrm{spread} = 1/\tau_s \approx$ 0.7
ns$^{-1}$. However, the basal and pyramidal facets produced estimated
equilibrium contact angles, $\theta_\infty \approx$ 35$^{\circ}$, while
prismatic and secondary prismatic had values for $\theta_\infty$ near
43$^{\circ}$ as seen in Table \ref{tab:kappa}.

These results indicate that by traditional measures, the basal and
pyramidal facets are more hydrophilic than the prismatic and secondary
prism facets, and surprisingly, that the differential hydrophilicities
of the crystal facets is not reflected in the spreading rate of the
droplet.

% This is in good agreement with our calculations of friction
% coefficients, in which the basal
% and pyramidal had a higher coefficient of kinetic friction than the
% prismatic and secondary prismatic. Due to this, we believe that the
% differences in friction coefficients can be attributed to the varying
% hydrophilicities of the facets. 

\subsection{Solid-liquid friction of the interfaces}
In a bulk fluid, the shear viscosity, $\eta$, can be determined
assuming a linear response to a shear stress,
\begin{equation}\label{Shenyu-11}
j_{z}(p_{x}) = \eta \frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial z}.
\end{equation}
Here $j_{z}(p_{x})$ is the flux (in $x$-momentum) that is transferred
in the $z$ direction (i.e. the shear stress). The RNEMD simulations
impose an artificial momentum flux between two regions of the
simulation, and the velocity gradient is the fluid's response. This
technique has now been applied quite widely to determine the
viscosities of a number of bulk fluids~\cite{Muller1999,Bordat2002,Cavalcanti2007}.

At the interface between two phases (e.g. liquid / solid) the same
momentum flux creates a velocity difference between the two materials,
and this can be used to define an interfacial friction coefficient
($\kappa$),
\begin{equation}\label{Shenyu-13}
j_{z}(p_{x}) = \kappa \left[ v_{x}(liquid) - v_{x}(solid) \right]
\end{equation}
where $v_{x}(solid)$ is the velocity of the solid and $v_{x}(liquid)$
is the velocity of the liquid measured at the hydrodynamic boundary
layer.

The simulations described here contain significant quantities of both
liquid and solid phases, and the momentum flux must traverse a region
of the liquid that is simultaneously under a thermal gradient.  Since
the liquid has a temperature-dependent shear viscosity, $\eta(T)$,
estimates of the solid-liquid friction coefficient can be obtained if
one knows the viscosity of the liquid at the interface (i.e. at the
melting temperature, $T_m$),
\begin{equation}\label{kappa-2}
\kappa = \frac{\eta(T_{m})}{\left[v_{x}(fluid)-v_{x}(solid)\right]}\left(\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial z}\right).
\end{equation}
For SPC/E, the melting temperature of Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ is estimated
to be 225~K~\cite{Bryk2002}.  To obtain the value of
$\eta(225\mathrm{~K})$ for the SPC/E model, a $31.09 \times 29.38
\times 124.39$ \AA\ box with 3744 water molecules in a disordered
configuration was equilibrated to 225~K, and five
statistically-independent shearing simulations were performed (with
imposed fluxes that spanned a range of $3 \rightarrow 13
\mathrm{~m~s}^{-1}$ ).  Each simulation was conducted in the
microcanonical ensemble with total simulation times of 5 ns. The
VSS-RNEMD exchanges were carried out every 2 fs. We estimate
$\eta(225\mathrm{~K})$ to be 0.0148 $\pm$ 0.0007 Pa s for SPC/E,
roughly ten times larger than the shear viscosity previously computed
at 280~K~\cite{Kuang2012}.

The interfacial friction coefficient can equivalently be expressed as
the ratio of the viscosity of the fluid to the hydrodynamic slip
length, $\kappa = \eta / \delta$. The slip length is an indication of
strength of the interactions between the solid and liquid phases,
although the connection between slip length and surface hydrophobicity
is not yet clear. In some simulations, the slip length has been found
to have a link to the effective surface
hydrophobicity~\cite{Sendner:2009uq}, although Ho \textit{et al.} have
found that liquid water can also slip on hydrophilic
surfaces~\cite{Ho:2011zr}. Experimental evidence for a direct tie
between slip length and hydrophobicity is also not
definitive. Total-internal reflection particle image velocimetry
(TIR-PIV) studies have suggested that there is a link between slip
length and effective
hydrophobicity~\cite{Lasne:2008vn,Bouzigues:2008ys}. However, recent
surface sensitive cross-correlation spectroscopy (TIR-FCCS)
measurements have seen similar slip behavior for both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic surfaces~\cite{Schaeffel:2013kx}.

In each of the systems studied here, the interfacial temperature was
kept fixed to 225~K, which ensured the viscosity of the fluid at the
interace was identical. Thus, any significant variation in $\kappa$
between the systems is a direct indicator of the slip length and the
effective interaction strength between the solid and liquid phases.

The calculated $\kappa$ values found for the four crystal facets of
Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ are shown in Table \ref{tab:kappa}. The basal and
pyramidal facets were found to have similar values of $\kappa \approx
6$ ($\times 10^{-4} \mathrm{amu~\AA}^{-2}\mathrm{fs}^{-1}$), while the
prismatic and secondary prism facets exhibited $\kappa \approx 3$
($\times 10^{-4} \mathrm{amu~\AA}^{-2}\mathrm{fs}^{-1}$). These
results are also essentially independent of the direction of the shear
relative to channels on the surfaces of the facets.  The friction
coefficients indicate that the basal and pyramidal facets have
significantly stronger interactions with liquid water than either of
the two prismatic facets.  This is in agreement with the contact angle
results above - both of the high-friction facets exhibited smaller
contact angles, suggesting that the solid-liquid friction (and inverse
slip length) is correlated with the hydrophilicity of these facets.

\subsection{Structural measures of interfacial width under shear}
One of the open questions about ice/water interfaces is whether the
thickness of the 'slush-like' quasi-liquid layer (QLL) depends on the
facet of ice presented to the water.  In the QLL region, the water
molecules are ordered differently than in either the solid or liquid
phases, and also exhibit distinct dynamical behavior.  The width of
this quasi-liquid layer has been estimated by finding the distance
over which structural order parameters or dynamic properties change
from their bulk liquid values to those of the solid ice.  The
properties used to find interfacial widths have included the local
density, the diffusion constant, and both translational and
orientational order
parameters~\cite{Karim1988,Karim1990,Hayward2001,Hayward2002,Bryk2002,Gay2002,Louden2013a}.

The VSS-RNEMD simulations impose thermal and velocity gradients.
These gradients perturb the momenta of the water molecules, so
parameters that depend on translational motion are often measuring the
momentum exchange, and not physical properties of the interface.  As a
structural measure of the interface, we have used the local
tetrahedral order parameter, which measures the match of the local
molecular environments (e.g. the angles between nearest neighbor
molecules) to perfect tetrahedral ordering.  This quantity was
originally described by Errington and Debenedetti~\cite{Errington2001}
and has been used in bulk simulations by Kumar \textit{et
  al.}~\cite{Kumar2009} It has previously been used in ice/water
interfaces by by Bryk and Haymet~\cite{Bryk2004b}.

To determine the structural widths of the interfaces under shear, each
of the systems was divided into 100 bins along the $z$-dimension, and
the local tetrahedral order parameter (Eq. 5 in Reference
\citealp{Louden13a}) was time-averaged in each bin for the duration of
the shearing simulation.  The spatial dependence of this order
parameter, $q(z)$, is the tetrahedrality profile of the interface.
The lower panels in figures 2-5 in the supporting information show
tetrahedrality profiles (in circles) for each of the four interfaces.
The $q(z)$ function has a range of $(0,1)$, where a value of unity
indicates a perfectly tetrahedral environment.  The $q(z)$ for the
bulk liquid was found to be $\approx~0.77$, while values of
$\approx~0.92$ were more common in the ice. The tetrahedrality
profiles were fit using a hyperbolic tangent function (see Eq. 6 in
Reference \citealp{Louden13a}) designed to smoothly fit the bulk to ice
transition while accounting for the weak thermal gradient. In panels
$b$ and $c$ of the same figures, the resulting thermal and velocity
gradients from an imposed kinetic energy and momentum fluxes can be
seen. The vertical dotted lines traversing these figures indicate the
midpoints of the interfaces as determined by the tetrahedrality
profiles.  The hyperbolic tangent fit provides an estimate of
$d_\mathrm{struct}$, the structural width of the interface.
 
We find the interfacial width to be $3.2 \pm 0.2$ \AA\ (pyramidal) and
$3.2 \pm 0.2$ \AA\ (secondary prism) for the control systems with no
applied momentum flux. This is similar to our previous results for the
interfacial widths of the quiescent basal ($3.2 \pm 0.4$ \AA) and
prismatic systems ($3.6 \pm 0.2$ \AA).

Over the range of shear rates investigated, $0.4 \rightarrow
6.0~\mathrm{~m~s}^{-1}$ for the pyramidal system and $0.6 \rightarrow
5.2~\mathrm{~m~s}^{-1}$ for the secondary prism, we found no
significant change in the interfacial width. The mean interfacial
widths are collected in table \ref{tab:kappa}. This follows our
previous findings of the basal and prismatic systems, in which the
interfacial widths of the basal and prismatic facets were also found
to be insensitive to the shear rate~\cite{Louden2013a}.

The similarity of these interfacial width estimates indicate that the
particular facet of the exposed ice crystal has little to no effect on
how far into the bulk the ice-like structural ordering persists. Also,
it appears that for the shearing rates imposed in this study, the
interfacial width is not structurally modified by the movement of
water over the ice.

\subsection{Dynamic measures of interfacial width under shear}
The spatially-resolved orientational time correlation function,
\begin{equation}\label{C(t)1}
  C_{2}(z,t)=\langle P_{2}(\mathbf{u}_i(0)\cdot \mathbf{u}_i(t))
  \delta(z_i(0) - z) \rangle,
\end{equation}
provides local information about the decorrelation of molecular
orientations in time. Here, $P_{2}$ is the second-order Legendre
polynomial, and $\mathbf{u}_i$ is the molecular vector that bisects
the HOH angle of molecule $i$.  The angle brackets indicate an average
over all the water molecules and time origins, and the delta function
restricts the average to specific regions. In the crystal, decay of
$C_2(z,t)$ is incomplete, while in the liquid, correlation times are
typically measured in ps.  Observing the spatial-transition between
the decay regimes can define a dynamic measure of the interfacial
width.

To determine the dynamic widths of the interfaces under shear, each of
the systems was divided into bins along the $z$-dimension ($\approx$ 3
\AA\ wide) and $C_2(z,t)$ was computed using only those molecules that
were in the bin at the initial time.  To compute these correlation
functions, each of the 0.5 ns simulations was followed by a shorter
200 ps microcanonical (NVE) simulation in which the positions and
orientations of every molecule in the system were recorded every 0.1
ps. 

The time-dependence was fit to a triexponential decay, with three time
constants: $\tau_{short}$, measuring the librational motion of the
water molecules, $\tau_{middle}$, measuring the timescale for breaking
and making of hydrogen bonds, and $\tau_{long}$, corresponding to the
translational motion of the water molecules.  An additional constant
was introduced in the fits to describe molecules in the crystal which
do not experience long-time orientational decay.

In Figures 6-9 in the supporting information, the $z$-coordinate
profiles for the three decay constants, $\tau_{short}$,
$\tau_{middle}$, and $\tau_{long}$ for the different interfaces are
shown.  (Figures 6 \& 7 are new results, and Figures 8 \& 9 are
updated plots from Ref \citealp{Louden13a}.)  In the liquid regions of
all four interfaces, we observe $\tau_{middle}$ and $\tau_{long}$ to
have approximately consistent values of $3-6$ ps and $30-40$ ps,
respectively.  Both of these times increase in value approaching the
interface.  Approaching the interface, we also observe that
$\tau_{short}$ decreases from its liquid-state value of $72-76$ fs.
The approximate values for the decay constants and the trends
approaching the interface match those reported previously for the
basal and prismatic interfaces.

We have estimated the dynamic interfacial width $d_\mathrm{dyn}$ by
fitting the profiles of all the three orientational time constants
with an exponential decay to the bulk-liquid behavior,
\begin{equation}\label{tauFit2}
  \tau(z)\approx\tau_{liquid}+(\tau_{wall}-\tau_{liquid})e^{-(z-z_{wall})/d_\mathrm{dyn}}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{liquid}$ and $\tau_{wall}$ are the liquid and projected
wall values of the decay constants, $z_{wall}$ is the location of the
interface, as measured by the structural order parameter.  These
values are shown in table \ref{tab:kappa}. Because the bins must be
quite wide to obtain reasonable profiles of $C_2(z,t)$, the error
estimates for the dynamic widths of the interface are significantly
larger than for the structural widths.  However, all four interfaces
exhibit dynamic widths that are significantly below 1~nm, and are in
reasonable agreement with the structural width above.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we used MD simulations to measure the advancing contact
angles of water droplets on the basal, prismatic, pyramidal, and
secondary prism facets of Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$.  Although we saw no
significant change in the \textit{rate} at which the droplets spread
over the surface, the long-time behavior predicts larger equilibrium
contact angles for the two prismatic facets.  

We have also used RNEMD simulations of water interfaces with the same
four crystal facets to compute solid-liquid friction coefficients.  We
have observed coefficients of friction that differ by a factor of two
between the two prismatic facets and the basal and pyramidal facets.
Because the solid-liquid friction coefficient is directly tied to the
inverse of the hydrodynamic slip length, this suggests that there are
significant differences in the overall interaction strengths between
these facets and the liquid layers immediately in contact with them.

The agreement between these two measures have lead us to conclude that
the two prismatic facets have a lower hydrophilicity than either the
basal or pyramidal facets.  One possible explanation of this behavior
is that the face presented by both prismatic facets consists of deep,
narrow channels (i.e. stripes of adjacent rows of pairs of
hydrogen-bound water molecules).  At the surfaces of these facets,
the channels are 6.35 \AA\ wide and the sub-surface ice layer is 2.25
\AA\ below (and therefore blocked from hydrogen bonding with the
liquid).  This means that only 1/2 of the surface molecules can form
hydrogen bonds with liquid-phase molecules.

In the basal plane, the surface features are shallower (1.3 \AA), with
no blocked subsurface layer.  The pyramidal face has much wider
channels (8.65 \AA) which are also quite shallow (1.37 \AA).  These
features allow liquid phase molecules to form hydrogen bonds with all
of the surface molecules in the basal and pyramidal facets.  This
means that for similar surface areas, the two prismatic facets have an
effective hydrogen bonding surface area of half of the basal and
pyramidal facets.  The reduction in the effective surface area would
explain much of the behavior observed in our simulations.

% *****************************************
% There is significant interest in the properties of ice/ice and ice/water 
% interfaces in the geophysics community. Most commonly, the results of shearing
% two ice blocks past one 
% another\cite{Casassa91, Sukhorukov13, Pritchard12, Lishman13} or the shearing 
% of ice through water\cite{Cuffey99, Bell08}. Using molecular dynamics 
% simulations, Samadashvili has recently shown that when two smooth ice slabs 
% slide past one another, a stable liquid-like layer develops between 
% them\cite{Samadashvili13}. To fundamentally understand these processes, a 
% molecular understanding of the ice/water interfaces is needed.     

% Investigation of the ice/water interface is also crucial in understanding
% processes such as nucleation, crystal 
% growth,\cite{Han92, Granasy95, Vanfleet95} and crystal 
% melting\cite{Weber83, Han92, Sakai96, Sakai96B}. Insight gained to these
% properties can also be applied to biological systems of interest, such as 
% the behavior of the antifreeze protein found in winter 
% flounder,\cite{Wierzbicki07,Chapsky97} and certain terrestial
% arthropods.\cite{Duman:2001qy,Meister29012013} Elucidating the properties which
% give rise to these processes through experimental techniques can be expensive,
% complicated, and sometimes infeasible. However, through the use of molecular 
% dynamics simulations much of the problems of investigating these properties
% are alleviated.

% Understanding ice/water interfaces inherently begins with the isolated
% systems. There has been extensive work parameterizing models for liquid water,
% such as the SPC\cite{Berendsen81}, SPC/E\cite{Berendsen87}, 
% TIP4P\cite{Jorgensen85}, TIP4P/2005\cite{Abascal05}, 
% ($\dots$), and more recently, models for simulating
% the solid phases of water, such as the TIP4P/Ice\cite{Abascal05b} model. The 
% melting point of various crystal structures of ice have been calculated for 
% many of these models
% (SPC\cite{Karim90,Abascal07}, SPC/E\cite{Baez95,Arbuckle02,Gay02,Bryk02,Bryk04b,Sanz04b,Gernandez06,Abascal07,Vrbka07}, TIP4P\cite{Karim88,Gao00,Sanz04,Sanz04b,Koyama04,Wang05,Fernandez06,Abascal07}, TIP5P\cite{Sanz04,Koyama04,Wang05,Fernandez06,Abascal07}), 
% and the partial or complete phase diagram for the model has been determined
% (SPC/E\cite{Baez95,Bryk04b,Sanz04b}, TIP4P\cite{Sanz04,Sanz04b,Koyama04}, TIP5P\cite{Sanz04,Koyama04}). 
% Knowing the behavior and melting point for these models has enabled an initial 
% investigation of ice/water interfaces. 

% The Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water quiescent interface has been extensively studied 
% over the past 30 years by theory and experiment. Haymet \emph{et al.} have 
% done significant work characterizing and quantifying the width of these 
% interfaces for the SPC,\cite{Karim90} SPC/E,\cite{Gay02,Bryk02}, 
% CF1,\cite{Hayward01,Hayward02} and TIP4P\cite{Karim88} models for water. In 
% recent years, Haymet has focused on investigating the effects cations and 
% anions have on crystal nucleaion and 
% melting.\cite{Bryk04,Smith05,Wilson08,Wilson10} Nada and Furukawa have studied
% the the basal- and prismatic-water interface width\cite{Nada95}, crystal 
% surface restructuring at temperatures approaching the melting 
% point\cite{Nada00}, and the mechanism of ice growth inhibition by antifreeze 
% proteins\cite{Nada08,Nada11,Nada12}. Nada has developed a six-site water model
% for ice/water interfaces near the melting point\cite{Nada03}, and studied the 
% dependence of crystal growth shape on applied pressure\cite{Nada11b}. Using 
% this model, Nada and Furukawa have established differential 
% growth rates for the basal, prismatic, and secondary prismatic facets of 
% Ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ and found their origins due to a reordering of the hydrogen 
% bond network in water near the interface\cite{Nada05}. While the work 
% described so far has mainly focused on bulk water on ice, there is significant
% interest in thin films of water on ice surfaces as well.  

% It is well known that the surface of ice exhibits a premelting layer at 
% temperatures near the melting point, often called a quasi-liquid layer (QLL).
% Molecular dynamics simulations of the facets of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ exposed
% to vacuum performed by Conde, Vega and Patrykiejew have found QLL widths of
% approximately 10 \AA\ at 3 K below the melting point\cite{Conde08}.
% Similarly, Limmer and Chandler have used course grain simulations and 
% statistical field theory to estimated QLL widths at the same temperature to
% be about 3 nm\cite{Limmer14}.
% Recently, Sazaki and Furukawa have developed an experimental technique with 
% sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to visulaize and quantitatively
% analyze QLLs on ice crystals at temperatures near melting\cite{Sazaki10}. They 
% have found the width of the QLLs perpindicular to the surface  at -2.2$^{o}$C 
% to be $\mathcal{O}$(\AA). They have also seen the formation of two immiscible
% QLLs, which displayed different stabilities and dynamics on the crystal 
% surface\cite{Sazaki12}. Knowledge of the hydrophilicities of each
% of the crystal facets would help further our understanding of the properties 
% and dynamics of the QLLs.
  
% Presented here is the follow up to our previous paper\cite{Louden13}, in which
% the basal and prismatic facets of an ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$/water interface were
% investigated where the ice was sheared relative to the liquid. By using a 
% recently developed velocity shearing and scaling approach to reverse 
% non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (VSS-RNEMD), simultaneous temperature and 
% velocity gradients can be applied to the system, which allows for measurment
% of friction and thermal transport properties while maintaining a stable 
% interfacial temperature\cite{Kuang12}. Structural analysis and dynamic
% correlation functions were used to probe the interfacial response to a shear, 
% and the resulting solid/liquid kinetic friction coefficients were reported.
% In this paper we present the same analysis for the pyramidal and secondary 
% prismatic facets, and show that the differential interfacial friction 
% coefficients for the four facets of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ are determined by their 
% relative hydrophilicity by means of dynamics water contact angle
% simulations. 

% The local tetrahedral order parameter, $q(z)$, is given by
% \begin{equation}
% q(z) = \int_0^L \sum_{k=1}^{N} \Bigg(1 -\frac{3}{8}\sum_{i=1}^{3}
% \sum_{j=i+1}^{4} \bigg(\cos\psi_{ikj}+\frac{1}{3}\bigg)^2\Bigg)
% \delta(z_{k}-z)\mathrm{d}z \Bigg/ N_z
% \label{eq:qz}
% \end{equation}
% where $\psi_{ikj}$ is the angle formed between the oxygen sites of molecules
% $i$,$k$, and $j$, where the centeral oxygen is located within molecule $k$ and 
% molecules $i$ and $j$ are two of the closest four water molecules
% around molecule $k$. All four closest neighbors of molecule $k$ are also
% required to reside within the first peak of the pair distribution function
% for molecule $k$ (typically $<$ 3.41 \AA\ for water). 
% $N_z = \int\delta(z_k - z) \mathrm{d}z$ is a normalization factor to account 
% for the varying population of molecules within each finite-width bin.


% The hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of a surface can be described by the
% extent a droplet of water wets the surface. The contact angle formed between
% the solid and the liquid, $\theta$, which relates the free energies of the 
% three interfaces involved, is given by Young's equation.
% \begin{equation}\label{young}
% \cos\theta = (\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})/\gamma_{lv}
% \end{equation} 
% Here $\gamma_{sv}$, $\gamma_{sl}$, and $\gamma_{lv}$ are the free energies
% of the solid/vapor, solid/liquid, and liquid/vapor interfaces respectively.
% Large contact angles ($\theta$ $\gg$ 90\textsuperscript{o}) correspond to low 
% wettability and hydrophobic surfaces, while small contact angles 
% ($\theta$ $\ll$ 90\textsuperscript{o}) correspond to high wettability and 
% hydrophilic surfaces. Experimentally, measurements of the contact angle
% of sessile drops has been used to quantify the extent of wetting on surfaces
% with thermally selective wetting charactaristics\cite{Tadanaga00,Liu04,Sun04},
% as well as nano-pillared surfaces with electrically tunable Cassie-Baxter and 
% Wenzel states\cite{Herbertson06,Dhindsa06,Verplanck07,Ahuja08,Manukyan11}. 
% Luzar and coworkers have done significant work modeling these transitions on 
% nano-patterned surfaces\cite{Daub07,Daub10,Daub11,Ritchie12}, and have found 
% the change in contact angle to be due to the external field perturbing the 
% hydrogen bonding of the liquid/vapor interface\cite{Daub07}.

\section{The Advancing Contact Angle}
The advancing contact angles for the liquid droplets were computed
using inversion of Eq. (2) in the main text which requires finding the
real roots of a fourth order polynomial,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:poly}
c_4 \cos^4 \theta + c_3 \cos^3 \theta + c_2 \cos^2 \theta + c_1
\cos \theta + c_0 = 0
\end{equation}
where the coefficients of the polynomial are expressed in terms of the
$z$ coordinate of the center of mass of the liquid droplet relative to
the solid surface, $z = z_\mathrm{cm} - z_\mathrm{surface}$, and a
factor that depends on the initial droplet radius, $k = 2^{-4/3} R_0$.
The coefficients are simple functions of these two quantities,
\begin{align}
c_4 &= z^3 + k^3 \\
c_3 &= 8 z^3 + 8 k^3 \\
c_2 &= 24 z^3 + 18 k^3 \\
c_1 &= 32 z^3 \\
c_0 &= 16 z^3 - 27 k^3 .
\end{align}
Solving for the values of the real roots of this polynomial
(Eq. \ref{eq:poly}) give estimates of the advancing contact angle.
The dynamics of this quantity for each of the four interfaces is shown
in figure 1 below.

\section{Interfacial widths using structural information}
To determine the structural widths of the interfaces under shear, each
of the systems was divided into 100 bins along the $z$-dimension, and
the local tetrahedral order parameter (Eq. 5 in Reference
\citealp{Louden2013a}) was time-averaged in each bin for the duration of
the shearing simulation.  The spatial dependence of this order
parameter, $q(z)$, is the tetrahedrality profile of the interface.
The lower panels in figures 2-5 show tetrahedrality profiles (in
circles) for each of the four interfaces.  The $q(z)$ function has a
range of $(0,1)$, where a value of unity indicates a perfectly
tetrahedral environment.  The $q(z)$ for the bulk liquid was found to
be $\approx~0.77$, while values of $\approx~0.92$ were more common in
the ice. The tetrahedrality profiles were fit using a hyperbolic
tangent function (see Eq. 6 in Reference \citealp{Louden2013a}) designed
to smoothly fit the bulk to ice transition while accounting for the
weak thermal gradient. In panels $b$ and $c$ of the same figures, the
resulting thermal and velocity gradients from an imposed kinetic
energy and momentum fluxes can be seen. The vertical dotted lines
traversing these figures indicate the midpoints of the interfaces as
determined by the tetrahedrality profiles.

\section{Interfacial widths using dynamic information}
To determine the dynamic widths of the interfaces under shear, each of
the systems was divided into bins along the $z$-dimension ($\approx$ 3
\AA\ wide) and $C_2(z,t)$ was computed using only those molecules that
were in the bin at the initial time.  To compute these correlation
functions, each of the 0.5 ns simulations was followed by a shorter
200 ps microcanonical (NVE) simulation in which the positions and
orientations of every molecule in the system were recorded every 0.1
ps. 

The time-dependence was fit to a triexponential decay, with three time
constants: $\tau_{short}$, measuring the librational motion of the
water molecules, $\tau_{middle}$, measuring the timescale for breaking
and making of hydrogen bonds, and $\tau_{long}$, corresponding to the
translational motion of the water molecules.  An additional constant
was introduced in the fits to describe molecules in the crystal which
do not experience long-time orientational decay.

In Figures 6-9, the $z$-coordinate profiles for the three decay
constants, $\tau_{short}$, $\tau_{middle}$, and $\tau_{long}$ for the
different interfaces are shown.  (Figures 6 \& 7 are new results,
and Figures 8 \& 9 are updated plots from Ref \citealp{Louden2013a}.)
In the liquid regions of all four interfaces, we observe
$\tau_{middle}$ and $\tau_{long}$ to have approximately consistent
values of $3-6$ ps and $30-40$ ps, respectively.  Both of these times
increase in value approaching the interface.  Approaching the
interface, we also observe that $\tau_{short}$ decreases from its
liquid-state value of $72-76$ fs.  The approximate values for the
decay constants and the trends approaching the interface match those
reported previously for the basal and prismatic interfaces.

We have estimated the dynamic interfacial width $d_\mathrm{dyn}$ by
fitting the profiles of all the three orientational time constants
with an exponential decay to the bulk-liquid behavior,
\begin{equation}\label{tauFit2}
  \tau(z)\approx\tau_{liquid}+(\tau_{wall}-\tau_{liquid})e^{-(z-z_{wall})/d_\mathrm{dyn}}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{liquid}$ and $\tau_{wall}$ are the liquid and projected
wall values of the decay constants, $z_{wall}$ is the location of the
interface, as measured by the structural order parameter.  These
values are shown in table 1 in the main text. Because the bins must be
quite wide to obtain reasonable profiles of $C_2(z,t)$, the error
estimates for the dynamic widths of the interface are significantly
larger than for the structural widths.  However, all four interfaces
exhibit dynamic widths that are significantly below 1~nm, and are in
reasonable agreement with the structural width above.
