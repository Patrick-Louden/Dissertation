\chapter{MEASUREMENTS OF THE VISCOSITY OF THE QUASI-LIQUID LAYER AT THE SURFACE OF ICE-I$_\mathrm{h}$}\label{chap:QLL}

\textit{``All is born of water; all is sustained by water.''} \\
-Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1817) \\
\end{flushright}

In the hydrodynamic friction regime, there are three distinct
contributions to the overall observed friction; the solid-liquid
friction between the ice and quasi-liquid layer (QLL), the viscous
shearing of the QLL, and the solid-liquid friction between the QLL and
the slider.\cite{Kietzig2009,Kietzig2010} In Chapter
\ref{chap:Friction}, we presented facet-dependent friction
coefficients for the basal, prismatic, 14\degree~pyramidal, and
secondary prism ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interfaces. In this
chapter, we present an investigation of the temperature dependence of
the shear viscosity of the QLL at the basal and prismatic
ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / vapor interfaces.



\section{Computational Methods}

\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Ice Surfaces}
\end{flushleft}

TIP4P/Ice basal and prismatic ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ primitive crystals
were constructed following the procedure described in Chapter
\ref{chap:Methods}. These primitive cells were then reoriented so that
the desired crystal face was exposed to the $y$ axis, then replicated
in the $x$- and $z$-dimensions to form large sheets. The sheets were
then replicated along the $y$-dimension until the basal crystal was 12
bilayers thick, and the prismatic crystal was replicated to a width of
approximately equal to the basal crystal. Dimensions and number of
molecules in each system are found in Table \ref{tab:qll-method}.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


The $y$-dimension of the simulation box was then set to 300~\AA~ to
allow for a surface premelt to form, and replicas of each system were
equilibrated to four temperatures, 255, 260, 265, and 270~K at
1~atm. The resulting systems exposed two interfaces, one toward
positive $y$ and the other towards negative $y$. Equilibration was
conducted under a constant surface tension and temperature integrator,
allowing the $x$- and $z$-dimensions of the simulation cell to relax
and alleviate any crystal strain. Following this, the systems were
equilibrated under a constant volume and temperature integrator (NVT),
and lastly under a constant volume and energy integrator (NVE). During
these simulations, the width of the crystal (in the $y$-dimension) was
monitored to ensure no appreciable crystal melt or large scale
restructuring occurred. Once equilibration was complete, a 100 ps
production simulation was performed for each system, where the
positions and velocities were recored every 0.1 ps.



% In Chapter \ref{chap:Str}, we found the
% tetrahedrality at the Gibbs dividing surface for ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
% water interfaces to be $q^{Gibbs} \sim$0.84. Here, we have used
% $q^{Gibbs}$ as the cutoff value between the QLL and the ice. All
% molecules with $q < q^{Gibbs}$ are denoted as QLL molecules, while
% those with $q > q^{Gibbs}$ are denoted to be ice. This cutoff
% coincides with a minimum in the tangential density profiles, as seen
% in the top and bottom panels of Figure \ref{fig:qll-rhoq}.

\textit{Supercooled Liquids}
\end{flushleft}
As a comparison to the structure and dynamics of the quasi-liquid
layer of ice, we have performed simulations of supercooled bulk liquid using the
TIP4P/Ice potential. A cubic box of 4,000 water molecules was
constructed and replicas were equilibrated to 255~K, 260~K, 265~K, and
270~K at 1 atm. System sizes and corresponding densities are presented in Table
\ref{tab:qll-liquid}. Once the liquid boxes were equilibrated, four
successive one nanosecond simulations were performed under an NVE
integrator. During these simulations, the positions and velocities
were stored every 100 fs.

\section{Simulations of Supercooled Liquid}
Henson \textit{et al.} predicted that the QLL should behave as a
supercooled bulk liquid.\cite{Henson2005} Studying supercooled liquids
experimentally, however, can be quite challenging. Besides possibly
skewing results, contaminants can also act as nucleation sites for
crystal growth. Due to this, much of our insight on supercooled liquid
water comes from molecular simulations. Crystal growth is an extremely
slow process on the computational timescale, allowing for
investigations of bulk liquid in this temperature regime. 

\subsection{Structural Measures of Supercooled Water}

\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Pair Distribution Function}
\end{flushleft}

The pair distribution function, $\mathrm{g}(r)$, provides information
regarding the spatial distribution of molecules. Calculation of this
function was achieved by compiling the average number of molecules
found to be a distance $r$ to ($r + \delta r$) apart. The
pair density $\rho (r)$ of each of these small shells is normalized by
the system's bulk density and the shell volume.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gofr}
\mathrm{g}(r) = \rho(r) / \rho^{bulk}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:gofr} is a general relation which can be used for
pairs of atoms, molecules, or even assemblies. Here, we have have
computed $\mathrm{g}(r)$ for pairs of water molecules, as
seen in the lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:gofrQ}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/bulk_GofrQdens}
\caption{\label{fig:gofrQ} Pair distribution function
  $\mathrm{g}(r)$ and probability density distributions of
  the local tetrahedral order parameter $\rho (\mathrm{q})$ for
  supercooled liquid water.
}
\end{figure*}  

We observe no population of pairs of water molecules at small values
of $r$. This is due to the size of a water molecule, modeled
by the repulsive portion of the Lennard-Jones potential. The large
peak at $r~\sim$ 2.8 corresponds to the first solvation
shell around the water molecules. The dip immediately following this
peak indicates a region of low population, followed by a second
smaller peak. This second peak captures the second solvation shell of
water, which is more diffuse than the first. At larger values of
$r$ the function approaches unity, indicating at large
separations the liquid ordering reflects that of the bulk. 

The two insets are closer views of the first and second solvation
shells. We see for colder temperature, the liquid becomes slightly
more ordered, apparent from the increase in the first and second
solvation shells, as well as the decrease in the population between
the two shells. In order to quantify this ordering, it is
common to integrate $\mathrm{g}(r)$ to determine the
coordination number $n_c$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nofr}
n_c = 4 \pi \rho^{bulk} \int_0^{r_m} g(r)r^2dr
\end{equation}

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

We find that the location of the minimum following the first peak
$r_m$ in $\mathrm{g}(r)$ is at slightly larger values of $r$ with
increasing temperature. Taking this as the limit of integration, the
coordination number for the first solvation shell, $n_c$ was computed
(see Table \ref{tab:gofr}). Similarly, $n_c$ is observed to increase with
increasing temperature. Since the supercooled liquid's density
increases with increasing temperature, we should expect a larger
coordination number with increasing temperature in this regime.

\vspace{0.6cm}
\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Density of Hydrogen Bonds}
\end{flushleft}

It is well known that water forms four hydrogen bonds in hexagonal
ice. In the liquid, water often adapts configurations which results in
a smaller number of hydrogen bonds. As an additional probe of the
supercooled liquid structure, we have computed the average fractional
populations of hydrogen bond participation ($\rho_\mathrm{HB}$) at
each of the four temperatures. To do so, we have used the hydrogen
bonding criteria of Luzar and Chandler, which requires the
oxygen-oxygen distance to be less than 3.4~\AA~, and the
oxygen-hydrogen-oxygen angle to be less than
30\degree.\cite{Luzar1996} This criteria has been shown to give good
agreement with energetic definitions of hydrogen bonds, as the
geometric and energetic definitions are intimately coupled. The
resulting fractional participation statistics can be found in Table
\ref{tab:gofr}.


% \begin{table}[h] \centering \caption{FRACTIONAL DENSITIES OF NUMBER OF
%     HYDROGEN BONDS FORMED FOR SUPERCOOLED LIQUID\label{tab:bulk_HB}}
% \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
% \hline
% \hline

% \hline
% 270 & 0.01645(3) & 0.1531(9) & 0.7771(3) & 0.05231(1)\\
% 265 & 0.01447(57) & 0.1432(4) & 0.7907(8) & 0.0507(2)\\

% \hline

% \end{tabular}
% \begin{flushleft}
% Temperatures are reported in K. Uncertainties are given in parentheses.
% \end{flushleft}
% \end{table}

Here, we observe a clear temperature dependence on the fractional
populations of of hydrogen bonds participation formed in the
liquid. At colder temperatures, we find a larger fraction of the
population form four hydrogen bonds. However, at warmer temperatures,
the reduction in population of four hydrogen bonded molecules results
in larger densities of molecules with two and three hydrogen bonds.


\vspace{0.6cm}
\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Density of Tetrahedral Ordering}
\end{flushleft}

While the pair distribution function provides information about
the spatial separation of molecules, it fails to discriminate any
orientational ordering which may be present in the liquid. In order to
query this orientational ordering, the density of local tetrahedral
order parameters, $\rho (q)$, observed during the simulation was
computed (see Figure \ref{fig:gofrQ}). This was accomplished by
computing $q$ for every molecule at each configuration, and determining
the fractional number of molecules which adopted this configuration.

In Figure \ref{fig:gofrQ}, we see a noticeable trend in $\rho (q)$
with increasing temperature. The $q$-value of the peak in the density
distribution decreases with increasing temperature. This indicates
that for warmer simulation temperatures, the tetrahedral ordering of
the liquid decreases. All four liquid simulations give a much broader
distribution than observed for a commensurate ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$
crystal at 270 K.





\subsection{Dynamic Measures of Supercooled Water}
At colder temperatures, we should expect the dynamics of water to be
slower simply due to lower kinetic energy. However, at colder
temperatures, water molecules may adapt structures which further hinder
dynamics. Since the density of tetrahedrality indicated an
orientational ordering in the liquid which was sensitive to
temperature, we may expect to observe temperature dependent dynamics
as well. Here, we have investigated both \textit{translational} and
\textit{orientational} measures of dynamics.

\vspace{0.6cm}
\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Diffusion in the Supercooled Liquid}
\end{flushleft}

Diffusion coefficients for water molecules in ice are approximately
zero, as the small amount of diffusion that is observed is highly
dependent on the presence of lattice defects. In contrast, diffusion
of water molecules in supercooled liquid is observed well below the
freezing point.\cite{Debenedetti2003} Pruppacher has measured the
diffusion of supercooled liquid down to -25\degree~C using a tritium
tracer.\cite{Pruppacher1972} In order to compare with the diffusion of
the quasi-liquid layers, we have computed three dimensional diffusion
coefficients for each of the bulk liquid simulations. Mean squared
displacements were computed for each of the supercooled liquid systems
(see lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:bulkD}), and the non-spatially
resolved version of Equation \eqref{eq:yDiff} was used to compute
average diffusion coefficients (see upper panel of the same figure).

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/bulkD}
\caption{\label{fig:bulkD} Lower panel: mean squared displacements
  (MSD) for supercooled liquid water. Upper panel: three dimensional
  diffusion constants computed from the MSD data in the lower panel. }
\end{figure*}    
 
We estimate diffusion coefficients of
$\mathrm{D}~\sim~ 1.0 \times 10^{-5}
(\mathrm{\AA}^{2}~\mathrm{fs}^{-1})$ to
$\mathrm{D}~\sim~ 3.0 \times 10^{-5}
(\mathrm{\AA}^{2}~\mathrm{fs}^{-1})$ for the range of temperatures
investigated. % The data are fit well with a linear regression giving a
% rate of change between the data of
% $0.1254 \times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{D}/\mathrm{K}$.

\vspace{0.6cm}
\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Orientational Decorrelation}
\end{flushleft}

Orientational time correlation functions provide information on the
decorrelation of molecular environments. As we observed in Chapter
\ref{chap:Dyn}, decorrelation times in ice go asymptotically to
infinity, while in liquid, values in the ps to ns range are more
common. In Chapter \ref{chap:Dyn} we computed a spatially resolved
version of the orientational time correlation function to probe how
the dynamics of molecules changed approaching the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
water interface. Here, all of the water molecules should behave
identically over a long time average as there are no interfaces present.
\begin{equation}\label{C(t)}
  C_{2}(t)=\langle P_{2}(\mathbf{u}_i(0)\cdot \mathbf{u}_i(t))\rangle,
\end{equation}
Again, $P_2$ is the second-order Legendre polynomial, 
$\mathbf{u}_i$ is the molecular unit vector that bisects the HOH angle
of molecule $i$, and the angle brackets denotes an average over all
molecules and time origins. Computed C$_2$(t) is shown in the lower
panel of Figure \ref{fig:jump_lcorr}.

There are three modes available for decorrelation of $C_2(t)$. Fitting
computed $C_2(t)$ by a triexponential decay which captures the
characteristic times for these modes can provide insight on the
temperature dependence of the reorientation of supercooled liquid
water. The three time constants: $\tau_\mathrm{short}$, measuring the
librational motion of the water molecules, $\tau_\mathrm{middle}$,
measuring the timescale for the large angle jumps during the breaking
and making of hydrogen bonds, and $\tau_\mathrm{long}$, corresponding
to the translational motion of the water molecules, can be obtained
by\cite{Louden2013a}
\begin{equation}
  C_{2}(t) = a~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{short}} + b~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{middle}} + 
  (1-a-b)~e^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{long}}.
\label{eq:c2}
\end{equation}
Here, the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $(1-a-b)$ give the fractional
amount of the total decay due to that particular mode. Averages of the
decay constants and their coefficients are reported in Table
\ref{tab:supOrient}.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

We observe a very clear temperature dependence in
$\tau_\mathrm{short}$, $\tau_\mathrm{middle}$, and
$\tau_\mathrm{long}$; for increasing temperatures, the decay time
decreases. We find the fast librational motion decay time to be
between 85 fs and 87 fs, while the slower hydrogen bond dynamics and
frame reorientation characteristic times of 4-10 ps, and 26-80 ps
respectively.  The fractional contribution of the short time
contribution increases with increasing temperature, while the
contributions due to hydrogen bond making and breaking events
contributes less with increasing temperature. The contribution of the slow frame
reorientation appears to be invariant to temperature, with 60$\%$
of the decay given by frame reorientation.

\vspace{0.6cm}
\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Hydrogen Bond Jump Times}
\end{flushleft}
The hydrogen bond jump time measures the decorrelation of a hydrogen
bond between two water molecules, $a$ and $b$. 
\begin{equation}\label{jump}
C_\mathrm{jump}(t) = 1 - \langle n_a(0) n_b(t) \rangle
\end{equation}
$n_a(0)$ is set to 1 if hydrogen $i$ is bound to water molecule $b$ at
time ($t=0$), and set to zero otherwise. A spatially resolved version
of this correlation function was described in Chapter \ref{chap:Dyn},
while here we are interested in the temperature dependence of the
hydrogen bond jump times. Again absorbing boundary conditions were
applied, \textit{i.e.} any back jumps were considered new hydrogen
bond formation events.

The hydrogen bond jump correlation function was computed for each of
the bulk liquid simulations, and the resulting $C_\mathrm{jump}(t)$
are plotted in the upper panel of Figure \ref{fig:jump_lcorr}. These
were found to be well fit by a single exponential decay, with a decay
constant describing the jump time for breaking and making hydrogen
bonds. From these characteristic decay times the jump rate can be
determined $k_\mathrm{jump} = \tau_\mathrm{jump}^{-1}$. These jump
rates are presented in Table \ref{tab:bulkJump}. We observe a clear
temperature dependence in the jump rates, at colder temperatures the
jump rates are smaller, around $k_\mathrm{jump} = 0.016$ (ps$^{-1}$),
and at warmer temperatures $k_\mathrm{jump} = 0.04$ (ps$^{-1}$).

\section{Characterization of the Quasi-Liquid Layer}
Formation of a quasi-liquid layer on the basal and prismatic surfaces
of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ was observed at all temperatures
investigated. Characterizing this surface premelt can be achieved by a
variety of order parameters. Here, we have chosen two structural
parameters, the local density and the local tetrahedral order
parameter described in Chapter \ref{chap:Str}. To compute profiles of
these measures, each of the systems investigated were divided into
small bins ($\delta y$) and an average of the order parameter was
computed for that bin. The resulting profiles for the basal and
prismatic systems at each temperature are presented in Figures
\ref{fig:basal_rhoq} and \ref{fig:prism_rhoq}.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/basal_qdens}
\caption{\label{fig:basal_rhoq} The spatially resolved average density
  (lower) and local tetrahedral order parameter (upper) of the
  exposed basal ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ crystal. Quasi-liquid layer (QLL)
  formation is observed in the outermost water bilayers. The Gibbs
  dividing surface of the QLL / vapor interface is indicated by
  vertical magenta lines. }
\end{figure*}                


\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/prism_qdens}
\caption{\label{fig:prism_rhoq} Panel description matches that of
  Figure \ref{fig:basal_rhoq}, but for the exposed prismatic
  ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ crystal. }
\end{figure*}                

In the lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:basal_rhoq}, the local density
for the basal systems shows a formation of a QLL starting at
displacements of $d\sim\pm$ 15 \AA~ from the center of the ice. The
peaks at displacements greater than 18 \AA~ shows wetting of the
underlying crystal. That is, the density does not go to zero between
the crystal and liquid-like planes. Interior to this, the
characteristic bilayer of ice is observed in the twin peaks at each
plane of ice. Note the outermost peaks have lost this bilayer
feature, further indicating its liquid-like character. Estimates of
the QLL width can be obtained by taking the edge of the QLL to be
where the density goes to 0.5 $\mathrm{g}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Comparing
the density profiles for the four temperatures investigated, we
observe a greater extent of wetting of the underlying crystal for
warmer temperatures. Similarly, the height of the QLL peaks decreases
with warmer temperature, indicating a more liquid-like environment.

In the bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:prism_rhoq}, the local density
for the prismatic systems indicates a quasi-liquid layer formation
around $d~\sim\pm$ 24. While the basal QLL density was found to be
$\rho~ \sim$~1.5 - 2.0 $\mathrm{g}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, we observe
densities closer to 1.0 $\mathrm{g}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ at the prismatic
surface. With increasing temperature, the same trend is observed at the
prismatic surface; at warmer temperatures the QLL's density comes
closer to that of the bulk liquid. We have estimated the width of the
QLL at each temperature investigated using the same density metric
described above. These estimates are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:qllWidth}.  

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/qllWidthT}
\caption{\label{fig:qllWidth} The temperature dependence of the width
  of the quasi-liquid layer as determined by density measures. The
  green and blue data are taken from Reference \cite{Conde2008}, and
  the purple data are taken from \cite{Bluhm2002}. }
\end{figure*}           

In Figure \ref{fig:qllWidth}, estimates for the basal (black) and
prismatic (red) interfaces show a relatively constant QLL width across
all four temperatures investigated, $w~\sim~6.7$~\AA. These results
agree well with values for the basal (green) and prismatic (blue) QLL
width obtained by Conde \textit{et al.} using the same
model.\cite{Conde2008} However, these estimates agree poorly with
near-edge X-ray absorption measurements of the basal surface taken by
Bluhm \textit{et al.}.\cite{Bluhm2002} Interestingly, no rigid,
non-polarizable water models are able to accurately capture the
divergence in the QLL width near the melting point,
$T_m = 273.15~\mathrm{K}$.\cite{Conde2008} This is not too surprising
considering the change in the dipole moment of individual water
molecules as their local environment changes from ice to QLL to vapor.

In the upper panels of Figures \ref{fig:basal_rhoq} and
\ref{fig:prism_rhoq} are the local tetrahedral order parameter
profiles through the interface. For the basal interface in Figure
\ref{fig:basal_rhoq}, we see the characteristic bilayer shapes in the
tetrahedrality profile. Interior to the ice, we observe $q$ values
close to 0.95, indicating a very tetrahedral environment. In the
region determined to be a QLL using density measures, the parameter
takes on values of 0.9 to 0.85. Beyond displacements of $d~\pm$~22
\AA~ from the center of the ice lies the vapor, and $q$ becomes small
and noisy due to the small population of molecules. The profile
presented in Figure \ref{fig:prism_rhoq} for the prismatic interface
appears very similar to that of the basal interface. It is interesting
to note, that since the tetrahedral order parameter depends on
neighboring molecules, it indicates that the crystal plane interior to
the QLL layer also deviates from bulk-like environments. This stems
from the outer layer being structured in a less tetrahedral
manner. While this could indicate that this first interior layer
should also be denoted as a QLL, perhaps it is more appropriate to
name this layer as a quasi-solid layer (QSL).


\section{Viscosity of the Quasi-Liquid Layer}

According to kinetic theory, the diffusion constant, $D$, can be
related to the mobility ($\mu$) of a particle and the temperature,
$T$.
\begin{equation}
D = \mu k_B T
\end{equation}
The mobility is often described as the ratio of the particle's
terminal velocity to an applied force. A specialized form of
this relation relates the diffusion constant to the shear viscosity
($\eta$) of the fluid.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stokes-einst}
D = \frac{k_BT}{4\pi \eta r}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:stokes-einst} was first derived by Einstein to
determine the diffusion constant for a ``Stokes'' particle of radius
$r$ undergoing Brownian Motion. 

\subsection{The Reduced Viscosity of the Quasi-Liquid Layer}
A reduced viscosity of the quasi-liquid layer can be obtained by
relating the viscosity of the QLL to that of a supercooled bulk
liquid at the same temperature.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eta*}
\eta^* = \frac{\eta^{\mathrm{qll}}}{\eta^{\mathrm{bulk}}}
\end{equation}

In order to compute estimates of the reduced viscosity of the QLL from
Equation \eqref{eq:eta*}, spatially resolved three dimensional
diffusion constants were computed in 1 \AA~bins along the dimension
normal to the ice surface.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:yDiff}
D(y) = \frac{1}{6t} \langle | \mathbf{r}_i(t) - \mathbf{r}_i(0) |^2
\delta(y_i(0) - y)  \rangle 
\end{equation}
Once obtained, it is a simple matter to scale each set of spatially
resolved diffusion coefficients by the diffusion coefficient for the
supercooled bulk liquid at the same temperature to obtain Figure
\ref{fig:basal_eta0} for the basal interface and Figure
\ref{fig:prism_eta0} for the prismatic interface. 

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/basal_eta0}
\caption{\label{fig:basal_eta0}The spatially resolved reduced
  viscosity at the basal surface of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$. The Gibbs
  dividing surface between the QLL and the vapor is indicated as a
  vertical magenta line.}
\end{figure*}                

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/prism_eta0}
\caption{\label{fig:prism_eta0} Panel description matches that of
  Figure \ref{fig:basal_eta0}, except for the prismatic surface of
  ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$.}
\end{figure*}                

In Figures \ref{fig:basal_eta0} and \ref{fig:prism_eta0}, we see close
to the ice the reduced viscosity is quite large, $\eta^* \sim 10$ to
$\eta^* \sim 100$, depending on the interface and temperature. Close
to the Gibbs dividing surface between the QLL and the vapor (magenta
vertical line), the reduced viscosity is close to 0.1 for both
interfaces. These results indicate that the viscosity of the QLL
varies drastically with distance from the ice surface. Using these
reduced viscosities along with a temperature dependent model for the
shear viscosity of the bulk supercooled liquid, we could obtain
estimates for the shear viscosities of the QLLs studied here.
           
\subsection{Shear Viscosity of Supercooled Liquid}
We have performed velocity shearing and scaling reverse
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in order to obtain a
temperature dependent model of the shear viscosity of supercooled bulk
liquid water. A liquid box containing $16,000$ TIP4P/Ice water
molecules with dimensions $\mathrm{L_x} = 51.22~\mathrm{\AA}$,
$\mathrm{L_y} = 51.22~\mathrm{\AA}$, and
$\mathrm{L_z}=200.87~\mathrm{\AA}$ was subjected to simultaneous
kinetic energy and momentum fluxes. This resulted in concurrent thermal
and velocity gradients across the $z$-dimension of the simulation
box. The velocity profile was fit with a quadratic regression, and an
analytic derivative with respect to the $z$ gave
$(\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial z}$). Together with the imposed
momentum flux, the shear viscosity is easily obtained.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:viscosity}
  j_{z}(p_{x}) = -\eta \big(\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial z}\big)
\end{equation}
The temperature gradient through the system was fit with a linear
regression. Using this regression, the local temperature for each
$\eta$ was obtained.  

The resulting $\eta$ values were fit with the Vogel Fulcher Tammann model
for predicting the shear viscosity of polymers and other liquids which
exhibit a glass transition temperature ($T_g~\sim~136~\mathrm{K}$ for
water). 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:WLF}
\eta (T) = \eta_0 \exp \Bigg({\frac{B}{T-T_0}}\Bigg)
\end{equation}
Here, $\eta_0$ and $B$, are fit parameters describing the infinite
temperature viscosity and the thermal energy required to change the
viscosity, respectively. $T_0$ is an empirical parameter, typically
taken to be the glass transition temperature ($T_g$).  With this it is
possible to estimate the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity
by knowing it only at one data point. Our data and resulting fit can
be seen in Figure \ref{fig:etaT}.
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/bulkVFT}
\caption{\label{fig:etaT} The shear viscosity $\eta$ of supercooled
  liquid water as a function of temperature. The black circles are
  data computed from a single VSS-RNEMD simulation with simultaneous
  kinetic energy and momentum fluxes, the red curve is a fit described
  by the Vogel Fulcher Tammann model.}
\end{figure*} 
Querying the fit at the four temperatures the ice surfaces were
investigated at, we can obtain reasonable estimates of the shear
viscosity for the supercooled bulk liquid. These values are reported
in Table \ref{tab:bulkVisco}.

\subsection{The Shear Viscosity of the Quasi-Liquid Layer}
Using the reduced viscosities of the quasi-liquid layers and the
temperature dependent model for the shear viscosity of bulk
supercooled liquid, we have estimated the shear viscosity of the QLLs
at the basal and prismatic surfaces of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qllT}
\eta^{\mathrm{qll}}(T) = \frac{\eta^{\mathrm{qll}}}{\eta^{\mathrm{bulk}}}\eta^{\mathrm{bulk}}(T)
\end{equation}
In Figure \ref{fig:qllEta}, the spatially resolved shear viscosity of
the basal (bottom panel) and prismatic (upper panel) interfaces are
reported. Close to the ice, we find shear viscosities between
$\eta(270~\mathrm{K}) = 35~\mathrm{cP}$ and
$\eta(255~\mathrm{K}) = 1100~\mathrm{cP}$ for the basal interface, and
between $\eta(270~\mathrm{K}) = 71~\mathrm{cP}$ and
$\eta(255~\mathrm{K}) = 5800~\mathrm{cP}$ at the prismatic
interface. At the QLL / vapor interface, the viscosity becomes
invariant to the presented crystal facet, and values of
$\eta(255~\mathrm{K}) = 16~\mathrm{cP}$ to
$\eta(270~\mathrm{K}) = 1~\mathrm{cP}$ are observed at both
interfaces. Between these two regions, we observe a continuous
distribution of $\eta^{\mathrm{qll}}(T)$ for both of the crystal
facets investigated. 

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/qllEta}
\caption{\label{fig:qllEta}The spatially resolved shear viscosity of
  the quasi-liquid layer at the basal (lower) and prismatic (upper)
  surfaces of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$. The vertical indigo line helps guide
  the eye between the ice and the QLL interface, and the magenta
  vertical line indicates the Gibbs dividing surface between the QLL
  and the vapor.}
\end{figure*} 

We attempted to compute the shear viscosity of the quasi-liquid layers
in a second way. Using VSS-RNEMD \cite{Kuang2012}, a shear stress was
applied only to molecules in the QLLs. The VSS-RNEMD exchange regions
were defined to incorporate molecules from both the top and bottom
interfaces, and partitioning between the vapor, QLLs, and the ice
surfaces was performed using the local tetrahedral order parameter of
the water molecules. However, application of the VSS-RNEMD moves
resulted in non-linear behavior in the velocity distributions of the
QLLs. The surface premelt layers were found to couple more strongly with the
underlying ice than the neighboring QLL, resulting in dissipation of
the velocity ``kicks'' into the ice instead of in the surface
premelt. Due to this, we were unable to resolve shear viscosities
using the VSS-RNEMD method.



\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Width of the Quasi-Liquid Layer}
Conde \textit{et al.} investigated water model dependence on the
formation of the quasi-liquid layer at the vapor exposed basal,
prismatic, and secondary prismatic surfaces of
ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$.\cite{Conde2008} They established a cutoff value in
the local tetrahedral order parameter, $q_t$, to denote molecules as
being ice-like or liquid-like. Using this, they estimated QLL widths
to be $w~\sim$~5 - 10~\AA~ for the TIP4P/Ice model over the range of
temperatures investigated here. These results agree well with our
density based estimates of the QLL width, of $w~\sim~6$~\AA~for both
the basal and prismatic facets.

As described in Chapter \ref{chap:Methods}, the basal and prismatic
surfaces used in this study exhibit proton ordering at the surface of
the crystal. This was chosen to reproduce sum frequency generation
spectroscopy which indicated proton ordering at the basal surface of
ice. Conversely, the ice surfaces simulated by Conde \textit{et al.}
presented disordered protons. Our results here indicate that the
proton-ordering at the basal and prismatic surfaces of
ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ do not significantly alter the width of the QLL as
compared to proton disordered surfaces.  Furthermore, Conde
established that the SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/2005, and TIP4P/Ice models
estimated QLLs of similar thickness, when compared to the relative
undercooling temperature of the model.\cite{Conde2008} Given that our
estimates of the thickness of the QLL agrees with that of Conde, we
believe our estimates should be robust for other water models as well,
but we have no evidence of this.

Neshyba \textit{et al.} investigated sublimation and deposition of
water molecules at the ice / vapor interface.\cite{Neshyba2009} They
also observed the formation of a QLL while using the NE6
model\cite{Nada2003a} at 250 K (T$_\mathrm{m}$ - 48 K for the NE6
model), and discriminated the QLL molecules by their intermolecular
potential energy. Doing so, they designated two separate QLLs, which
we have described as a single QLL here. They distinguish an outer QLL
which contains roughly 8\% of the total molecules, and an inner, more
crystalline QLL containing the remaining 92\%. 

As we observed in Figures \ref{fig:basal_rhoq} and
\ref{fig:prism_rhoq}, the value of the density and tetrahedrality in
the QLL is very local. We observe, that the structure and dynamics of
the water molecules vary drastically from the vapor to the QLL / ice
interface, and assigning an average value for any of the parameters
investigated here for each of the QLLs studied would be improper.


\subsection{Anisotropic Diffusion of the Quasi-Liquid Layer}
Pfalzgraff \textit{et al.}\cite{Pfalzgraff2011} and later Gladich
\textit{et al.}\cite{Gladich2011,Gladich2015} observed anisotropic
diffusion of the QLL on the prismatic, 14\degree~ pyramidal, and
secondary prismatic surfaces of an ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ crystal. This
behavior was prominent at colder temperatures (60 to 40 K of
undercooling) where the QLLs were thin and the water contributing to
the QLL is significantly influenced by the underlying crystal
structure. Since the underlying crystal exhibits an anisotropic
potential energy surface for movement of the QLL water molecules, the
resulting diffusion is biased by the directional dependent
energetics. At warmer temperatures and correspondingly thicker QLLs,
isotropic diffusion is recovered.

Here, we have computed one dimensional diffusion constants for small
($\delta y$) bins normal to the basal and prismatic ice surfaces.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1dDiff}
D_i = \frac{1}{2t} \langle | {r}_i(t) - {r}_i(0) |^2
\delta(y(0) - y)  \rangle 
\end{equation}
Taking the ratio of $D_x / D_z$, where $x$ is towards the secondary
prismatic face on the basal surface, and towards the basal face on the
prismatic surface, we have obtained the results shown in Figure
\ref{fig:dxdz}. At the basal surface (lower panel), we observe
isotropic diffusion for all four temperatures investigated. This
agrees well with Gladich \textit{et al.},\cite{Gladich2011} although
they conjectured that at extreme undercooling and correspondingly
sufficiently thin QLL, the basal surface may display anisotropic
diffusion relative to its six-fold symmetry.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/rd}
\caption{\label{fig:dxdz}The ratio of one dimensional diffusion
  constants for the basal (lower) and prismatic (upper)
  surfaces. Details about which crystal face the axis point towards is
  given in text.}
\end{figure*} 

Conversely, we observe anisotropic diffusion at the prismatic surface
in the top panel. Close to the ice crystal, the large error bars do
not allow us to clearly resolve if the diffusion is biased. At
distances between 3 and 6 \AA~away from the ice / QLL interface, we
clearly see a bias for diffusion along the $x$-dimension. This result
challenges the theory of Gladich \textit{et al.}, in which they
proposed anisotropic diffusion occurring close to the ice surface. In
addition, they predicted that isotropic diffusion should be recovered
by 30 degrees of undercooling, although we have observed anisotropic
diffusion up to 1 or 2 degrees of undercooling with the TIP4P/Ice
model. We have computed spatially resolved one dimensional diffusion
constants, however, Gladich computed an average diffusion constant for
the entire QLL. This may explain some of the differences observed
between their investigations and our presented results.

\subsection{Quasi-Liquid Layer Viscosity}
Comparing the spatially resolved shear viscosities of the QLLs with
the values obtained for supercooled liquid water in Table
\ref{tab:bulkVisco}, we see that the bulk liquid agrees within error
with the QLLs at approximately 4 - 5~\AA~ from the surface, for both
the basal and prismatic surfaces. At distances closer to the ice
surface, the shear viscosities of the QLLs are much greater than that
of the bulk liquid, and similarly at distance greater than 4 - 5~\AA~
from the ice / QLL interface the shear viscosity drops below that of
the bulk.

There are a few reasons why we see disagreement between the
supercooled liquid and the QLL viscosities near the ice or vapor
phases. Close to the ice, the QLL water experiences a confined space
and therefore the barrier for movement becomes larger. Similarly, the
close proximity to the ice surface may cause a templating of the
liquid, as the static potential energy surface exhibited by the ice
surface could also increase the barrier for movement. Close to the
vapor, the smaller values of $\eta$ may be due to the open
environment.  In contrast, the bulk liquid at the same temperature is
subjected to a moderate confined space, somewhere between the
excluded volume due to the ice surface, and that of the open vapor
phase. This may explain why the shear viscosity in the middle of the
QLLs agrees with that of the bulk. 

A second possibility is that the local structure of the molecules in
the QLL is different from that of the bulk liquid. From the top panel
of Figure \ref{fig:gofrQ}, the supercooled bulk liquid's
tetrahedrality distribution has a maximum of about $q \sim$~0.89, and
is observed to decrease slightly with increasing
temperature. Conversely, in the top panels of Figure
\ref{fig:basal_rhoq} and \ref{fig:prism_rhoq}, $q$ for the QLLs varies
drastically with distance from the ice / QLL interface. At distances
of $d~\sim~4 - 5$~\AA~ from the ice / QLL interface, the
tetrahedrality of the QLLs agrees reasonably with the supercooled bulk
liquid. This may also help explain why the local shear viscosity at
this distance from the ice / QLL interface agrees with the bulk liquid
of the same temperature. 

Lastly, comparing the shear viscosities close the ice / QLL interface
for the basal and prismatic surfaces, we see that at all temperatures
investigated
$\eta_{\mathrm{prism}}^{\mathrm{QLL}}~>~\eta_{\mathrm{basal}}^{\mathrm{QLL}}$. This
result agrees well with our calculations of the friction coefficients
in Chapter \ref{chap:Friction}, where we found
$\kappa_{\mathrm{prism}}~ >~\kappa_{\mathrm{basal}}$. Conversely,
close to the QLL / vapor interface,
$\eta_{\mathrm{prism}}^{\mathrm{QLL}}$ and
$\eta_{\mathrm{basal}}^{\mathrm{QLL}}$ come into agreement, and are
much smaller, varying from $\eta = 17.5$~cP to $\eta = 1.7$~cP. We
conclude that the small coefficients of friction commonly associated
with ice surfaces to be due to the small shear viscosity found for
water molecules near the QLL / vapor interface. 


% Similarly, Dehaoui
% \textit{et al.} have measured the viscosity of supercooled water down
% to -34\degree C without freezing the liquid.\cite{Dehaoui2015} There
% have been suggestions that Equation \eqref{eq:stokes-einst} breaks
% down at temperatures close to T$_\mathrm{g}$, the glass transition
% temperature, implying that the translational diffusion and the shear
% viscosity of the liquid become decoupled.


% As seen in Figure \ref{fig:qll-rhoq}, the QLLs at the surface of the
% basal and prismatic crystals form a bilayer. Following Neshyba
% \textit{et al.}, we denote the following definitions; molecules within
% the ice are labeled as $\mu_{i}$, where each $i$ denotes a unique
% density peak in the ice, molecules in the QLL layer closer to the ice
% are labeled as $\epsilon_{2}$, and molecules in the outer portion of
% the QLL bilayer are labeled as $\epsilon_{1}$.\cite{Neshyba2009} Due
% to their relative distances from the underlying crystal, molecules
% within layers $\epsilon_{2}$ and $\epsilon_{1}$ experience vastly
% different local environments. Water molecules within $\epsilon_{2}$
% located closer to the ice experience significantly more drag than
% those closer to the vapor. Therefore, we expect a noticeably different
% sheer viscosity for the molecules located in $\epsilon_{2}$ and
% $\epsilon_{1}$. 


% % In a recent review of Ice Surfaces, Mary Jane Shultz posed numerous
% % open questions about the qll, such as what is the growth mechanism,

% % Determination of Surface Tension-to-Shear Viscosity Ratio for
% % Quasi-liquid layers on Ice Crystal Surfaces.
% %   K. Murata, H. Asakawa, K. Nagashima, Y. Furukawa, G. Sazaki
% %   PRL 115 (2015) 256103
% Using laser confocal microscopy in conjunction with an inverted
% optical microscope, Murata \textit{et al.} have recently measured the
% characteristic-velocity (\textit{i.e.} the surface tension-to-shear
% viscosity ratio) of two distinct wetting morphologies of QLLs on the
% basal surface of ice at -0.2 degrees Celcius and a pressure of 578.9
% Pa.\cite{Murata2015} They observed a partial wetting QLL, described as
% a bulk liquid droplet (BLD), as well as a complete wetting state,
% described as a thin liquid layer (TLL). The characterstic-velocity of
% the BLDs was determined from relaxation modes of their contact lines,
% which was observed to decay with single exponential behavior according
% to
% \begin{equation}
% u_q = u_q(0) exp\Bigg(-\frac{V^* \theta^3 q}{3l}t\Bigg)
% \end{equation}
% where $q$ is the wave vector for the perturbing mode for the
% relaxation of the amplitude of the contact line and $u_q(0)$ being the
% initial amplitude of the mode. Here, $V^* = \gamma / \eta$ is the
% characteristic velocity and $\theta$ is the contact angle the BLD makes
% with the ice surface ($\sim$ 2 degrees). Lastly, the logarithmic factor
% $l=ln(L/a)$ is a cutoff parameter which helps avoid
% singularities. From this fit, they obtained $V^* = 2 \pm 1$ m/s, which
% is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of bulk water, 42.21
% m/s.

% Murata \textit{et al.} also investigated the spreading dynamics of the
% BLD-QLLs, during the transformations to TLL-QLLs. The radii of the
% spreading BLD-QLLs were fit to a power law
% \begin{equation}
% r = L (\frac{4S}{3Ll \eta})^{1/4}(t+t_0)^{1/4}.
% \end{equation}
% Here, $S$ is the spreading coefficient, and $t_0$ captures the initial
% state of the droplet. As the QLL transitions from the BLD
% drpolet-shape to the TLL pancake-shape, the volume must be
% conserved. From this conservation, Murata \textit{et al.} estimated
% the thickness of the TLLs as 9 $\pm$ 3 nm.

% Lastly, Murata \textit{et al.} have obtained the characteristic
% velocity of the TLLs in the same way as the BLDs. However, here the
% hydrodynamic dissipation is not located at the wedge of the droplet
% like in the BLD case, but instead the dissipation occurs within the
% fluid of the pancake-shape object itself. Due to this, a slightly
% different expression for the viscous force must be used, and the
% resulting characteristic velocity was found to be $V^* = 0.2 \pm 0.1$
% m/s, about 200 times smaller than that of bulk water. This seems to
% imply a dependence on the characteristic velocity to the QLLs contact
% area and distance from the surface. The BLD droplet-shaped QLLs (where
% the QLL is only partially wets the surface and a larger amount of the
% QLL resides further from the surface), were found to have a
% characteristic velocity of about an order of magnitude larger than the
% more completely wetting state, where more of the QLL resides closer to
% the surface.

% It is interesting to note that the surface tension of the BLD/air
% interface ($\gamma_t$) is approximately equal to the TLL/air interface
% surface tension ($\gamma_b$), as there is observed coexistence of both
% forms of QLLs at the same time. Therefore, the discrepancy in $V^*$
% can be primarily attributed to the shear viscosity of the QLL phase.

% %Outstanding references and background
% Molecular dynamics simulations of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ with a free
% surface were performed using the SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ice, and
% TIP5P/2005 water models. The basal, prismatic, and secondary prismatic

% cases the width of the liquid layer is found to increase with
% increasing temperature. For a given temperature, the following trend
% in QLL thickness was observed, the basal plane > the primary prismatic
% plane > the secondary prismatic plane. For the TIP4P/Ice model, the
% onset temperature of the QLL was observed at -100 degrees Celcius for
% the basal plan, -80 degrees Celcius for the primary prismatic plane,
% and -70 degrees Celcius for the secondary prismatic plane. NVT
% simulations between 6 and 12 ns. To discriminate icelike and
% liquid-like water molecules, they have used the local tetrahedral order
% parameter of Errington and Debenedetti. However, their values are
% locked at only the four closest neighbors.

% Conde \textit{et al.} have computed probability densities of the local
% tetrahedral order parameter, $p(q)$, for both a bulk liquid and bulk
% icesystem for all the models investigated. The TIP4P model results
% were almost indistinguishable, and the SPC/E model results were in
% good agreement with the TIP4P/Ice results considering the large
% discrepancy between the melting points of the models. However, there
% is visible overlap between the bulk liquid and bulk ice distributions,
% making discrimination between icelike and liquid-like molecules
% difficult. Therefore, they defined a cutoff value of $q$, denoted
% $q_{t}$, where molecules with $q < q_t$ are denoted to be liquid-like,
% and molecules found with $q > q_t$ are denoted as ice-like. 
% \begin{equation}
% \int_{q_t}^{1} p_{liquid}(q)dq = \int_{0}^{q_t} p_{I_h}(q)dq
% \end{equation}
% Here, $\int_{q_t}^{1} p_{liquid}(q)dq$ is the probability of
% incorrectly assigning a liquid-like water molecule as icelike, and
% similarly $\int_{0}^{q_t} p_{I_h}(q)dq$ is the probability of
% incorrectly assigning an icelike water molecule as
% liquid-like. Graphically, $q_t$ is the value of $q$ where the area
% under the $p_{liquid}(q)$ curve to the left of $q_t$ is equal to the
% area under the $p_{I_h}(q)$ curve to the right of $q_t$.  The values
% for $q_t$ were found to be approximately the same for each model
% investigated, with $q_t$ (SPC/E) $\sim 0.9101$ and
% $q_t$ (TIP4P/Ice) $\sim 0.9076$. 

% The width of the QLL was obtained by
% \begin{equation}
% \delta =
% \frac{N_\mathrm{liquid}M}{2\rho N_\mathrm{AV}L_\mathrm{y}L_\mathrm{z}}
% \end{equation}
% where $N_{liquid}$ is taken to be the average number of liquid-like
% molecules during the simulation, $M$ is the molecular weight of water,
% $N_{AV}$ is Avogadro's number, the product $L_yL_z$ is the area of the
% exposed crystal face, and $\rho$ is the density of liquid water. The
% factor of 2 in the denominator accounts for the two interfaces which
% are presented by the crystal in the simulation cell. However, their
% definition of the thickness of the QLL is inherently flawed in the
% following way. Since their definition of liquid-like molecules comes
% from their local tetrahedral order number which assumes four nearest
% neighbors, molecules at the surface of the crystal will have an
% artificially low value for $q$ and be labeled as liquid-like, even
% though their structure (based on angles between neighbors) is
% indicative of an icelike environment. A rescaling based on the number
% of neighbors present would give a more accurate result. 

% Conde \textit{et al.} also considered a dynamic criteria for whether a
% water molecule is liquid-like or icelike. They computed the mean-square
% displacement of each water molecule, and compared these values to
% reference data of the TIP4P/2005 water model mean-square displacement

% Experiments have shown that anisotropic surface melting occurs on the
% surface of the basal and prismatic faces of an ice crystal, just below
% the melting point. That is, at temperatures approaching the melting
% point, the basal QLL is thicker than the prismatic QLL. 

% A nice summary of ellipsometry measurements is given in the
% intro. References 12 and 14 therein, simultaneously measured both the
% thickness of the QLL as well as the index of refraction of the
% transition layer on the ice surface using null ellipsometry (what is
% null ellipsometry). From -2 degrees Celcius, the thickness of the QLL
% steeply increased with increasing temperature. The index of refraction
% was found to be 1.330 (which converts to a density of 991
% $kg/m^{3}$. Comparatively, the index of refraction for water is 1.333
% and bulk ice is 1.308. The QLL thickness of the prismatic facet was
% found to be proportional to $delta T ^{-1/3}$ above -2 degrees
% celcius, while the basal temperature dependence was much steeper. They
% also observed a flat facet at the melting point for the basal face,
% however, the prismatic facet exhibited a rounded surface at -2C. Thus
% a roughening transition is believed to occur on the prismatic facet
% while not on the basal facet.\cite{Furukawa1997}

% Nada used the $S$ order parameter of Karim and Haymet which depends on
% the orientational ordering of neighboring molecules.\cite{Karim1988}
% This parameter is unity for an ordered arrangement of water molecules
% in an ice crystal, and $\approx$ 0.3 for a random
% arrangement. Furukawa and Nada defined QLL to be present only if a
% slice of water molecules had $S \le 0.1$. References 18 and 22 therein

% \subsubsection{Anisotropic Diffusion of the QLL}
% One dimensional diffusion coefficients (D$_\mathrm{i}$) were computed
% via the Einstein's relation\cite{Allen1987}
% \begin{equation}
% D_{i} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dMSD_{i}(t)}{dt}
% \end{equation}
% where MSD$_\mathrm{i}(t)$ is the mean square displacements as a
% function of time. Gladich \textit{et al.} were careful to exclude any
% sublimating water molecules from being included in their calculation,
% as these molecules move considerably further distances in time than
% their condensed phase counterparts. These MSD$_\mathrm{i}(t)$ were
% staggered in starting time by 20~ps, averaged, and from this average
% MSD$_\mathrm{i}(t)$ the $D_\mathrm{i}$ were obtained by fitting the
% linear portion of the MSD$_\mathrm{i}(t)$ plots, between 5 and 25
% ns. However, they argue the obtained $D_\mathrm{i}$ values need
% correction, as the molecules residing in the solid ice, and ice-like
% molecules within the QLL are incorporated into the calculation of
% $D_\mathrm{i}$ through MSD$_\mathrm{i}(t)$ at this point. They assume
% only liquid-like molecules in the QLL contribute to the surface
% diffusivity, and compute surface diffusion constants
% $D^{*}_\mathrm{i}$ according to\cite{Pfalzgraff2011}
% \begin{equation}\label{D*}
% D^{*}_\mathrm{i} = D_\mathrm{i}/Q
% \end{equation}
% where $Q$ is the mean number of molecules classified as liquid-like
% ($N_\mathrm{LL}$) divided by the total number of molecules in the
% system ($N_\mathrm{Slab}$). They obtain $Q$ by the following simple
% ration, where they exclude sublimating molecules ($N_\mathrm{EV}$
% since they were removed from the MSD$_\mathrm{i}(t)$ calculations
% earlier.
% \begin{equation}
% Q = \frac{N_\mathrm{LL} - N_\mathrm{EV}}{N_\mathrm{Slab} -
%   N_\mathrm{EV}}
% \end{equation}
% This approach to obtaining the scaling parameter $Q$ improves upon the
% method of Pfalzgraff \text{et al.}\cite{Pfalzgraff2011}, where they included every
% molecule in one ice bilayer, including those that had
% sublimated. Using eq. \eqref{D*}, Gladich \textit{et al.} were also
% able to compute two-dimensional surface diffusion constants.
% \begin{equation}
% D^{*}_\mathrm{ij} = (D^{*}_\mathrm{i} + D^{*}_\mathrm{j}) / 2
% \end{equation} 

% Observing the density of the crystal at partitions transverse to the
% interface, Gladich observed the prismatic surface QLL grows
% continuously with increasing temperature. At the lowest temperatures
% investigated, 230~K, only the outermost bilayer was observed to
% participate in the formation of the QLL. At two degrees below the
% melting point of the NE6 model, the density profiles indicated that
% the two outermost bilayers both are involved in the QLL
% formation. This result was similar to those seen by Bishop \textit{et
%   al.}, who studied the basal ice surface also using the NE6 water
% model. These results also agree with those reported by Conde
% \textit{et al.}, who studied QLL on the basal, prismatic, and
% secondary prismatic using the SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ice, and TIP4P/2005
% water models.\cite{Conde2008} 

% Gladich \textit{et al.} estimated QLL thickness ($\delta$) relating
% the number of liquid-like quasi-liquid layer molecule
% ($N_\mathrm{LL}$) to the number of water molecules in a bulk liquid
% with box dimensions of $L_\mathrm{x}L_\mathrm{y}\delta$,
% \begin{equation}
% \delta =
% \frac{N_\mathrm{LL}M}{2\rho N_\mathrm{A}L_\mathrm{x}L_\mathrm{y}}
% \end{equation}
% where $M$ is the molar mass of water, $N_{A}$ is Avogadro's number,
% and $\rho$ is the density of liquid water; the factor of two accounts for
% the two interfaces presented by the QLL simulations. Using the
% values of $\rho$ reported by Nada and van der Eerden for supercooled
% liquid water with the NE6 potential,\cite{Nada2003} Gladich computed
% $\delta$ at each temperature investigated, and found the QLL to
% increase from 3.2 \AA~ wide at 59K of undercooling to 7.4 \AA~ at two
% degrees of undercooling.  

% They note a low value of $q$ can be obtained for water molecules
% incorporating an amorphous solid, in which water molecules are four
% coordinate, but are not structured in a tetrahedral arrangement but
% instead in a distorted tetrahedron. 

% Conde \textit{et al.} studied surface QLL on the prismatic facet using
% the TIP4P/Ice water model,\cite{Conde2008} and it was found that the NE6
% model systematically predicts a lower QLL thickness, due to the
% overstructuring of water. Based on their discrimination of
% N$_\mathrm{LL}$ molecules given $q_\mathrm{t}$, the NE6 model was
% found to have a larger value for $q_\mathrm{t}$, which would thus
% result in fewer molecules being considered QLL.

% Gladich \textit{et al.} watched movement of water molecules in the QLL
% along each axis independently, and found at low temperatures that
% movement normal to the interface happened in concert with large
% displacements in the normal plane, even when the normal motion is
% still well within the defined QLL. Therefore, these motions transverse
% to the interface will largely influence surface diffusion of the
% molecules. These motions were in good agreement with the diffusion
% mechanism proposed by Bishop \textit{et al.}\cite{Bishop2009} and by Bolton
% and Pettersson\cite{Bolton2000}, which suggested the outermost molecules of
% the QLL moved across a relatively rigid surface. Diffusion
% characterized in this way will be highly sensitive to the underlying
% surface morphology and topography, mainly, if the surface geometry or
% potential energy surface is anisotropic, we should expect diffusion
% across this surface to also be anisotropic. 

% Observations that in-plane diffusion follows motions transverse to the
% interface were observed at the warmer temperature as well. Through
% this vertical motion, the QLL molecule leaves a well-hydrated local
% environment to the outer portion of the surface where there are fewer
% hydrogen bond partners. Gladich notes that the activation energy for
% diffusion at the warmer temperature might actually be larger than that
% for the colder. With increasing temperature and a thicker
% surface premelting forming, the differing surface topography is masked
% and thus there is no observed anisotropy in surface diffusion.

% Plotting the surface diffusion along the two axis independently
% ($D^{*}_\mathrm{x}$, $D^{*}_\mathrm{z}$) against inverse temperature,
% the activation energy ($E_\mathrm{a}$) for the diffusion was
% extracted. Since the curvature of ln$D^{*}$ by inverse temperature is
% positive, Gladich concludes the activation energy for the
% high-temperature mechanism for diffusion is greater than that of the
% low-temperature. They further estimate these values to be 29.1 kJ
% mol$^{-1}$ for $E_\mathrm{a}$ the low-temperature (approximately the
% energy of on hydrogen bond with the NE6 model, 24.5 kJ mol$^{mol-1}$) and 24.5 kJ
% mol$^{-1}$ for that of the high-temperature (roughly two hydrogen bonds). 

% Nasello \textit{et al.} investigated surface diffusivity of ice by
% observing the formation of grain boundaries on polycrystalline ice
% surfaces.\cite{Nasello2007} Gladich's computed values for surface diffusivity
% agree well with those by Nasello as Gladich's values fall within the
% error bars reported by Nasello. Gladich's work agrees well with the
% experimental work reported by Price \textit{et al.}\cite{Price1999},
% especially at warmer temperatures. At cooler temperatures however,
% Gladich seems to underestimate surface diffusivity.

% It is interesting to note that at warm temperatures, simulations of
% supercooled bulk liquid\cite{Picaud2006} have also reproduced surface
% diffusivity measured by Price \textit{et al.}. However, the
% supercooled bulk liquid simulations predict a negative Arrhenius
% curvature, implying the activation energy of diffusion decreases with
% increasing temperature, opposite of that observed by Price \textit{et
%   al.} and predicted by Gladich \textit{et al.}. Given the difference
% in sign for the estimated activation energies, it is clear the
% mechanism predicted in each case is drastically different. 

% Gladich \textit{et al.} estimated the temperature at which the
% anisotropic surface diffusivity becomes isotropic by plotting the
% ratio of surface diffusions ($D^{*}_\mathrm{x}$ / $D^{*}_\mathrm{z}$)
% by temperature. They observed a transition to about unity between 240K
% and 250K, between 49 and 39 K of undercooling for the NE6 model.

% %   PRL 115 (2015) 256103
% Using laser confocal microscopy in conjunction with an inverted
% optical microscope, Murata \textit{et al.} have recently measured the
% characteristic-velocity (\textit{i.e.} the surface tension-to-shear
% viscosity ratio) of two distinct wetting morphologies of QLLs on the
% basal surface of ice at -0.2 degrees Celcius and a pressure of 578.9
% Pa.\cite{Murata2015} They observed a partial wetting QLL, described as
% a bulk liquid droplet (BLD), as well as a complete wetting state,
% described as a thin liquid layer (TLL). The characterstic-velocity of
% the BLDs was determined from relaxation modes of their contact lines,
% which was observed to decay with single exponential behavior according
% to
% \begin{equation}
% u_q = u_q(0) exp\Bigg(-\frac{V^* \theta^3 q}{3l}t\Bigg)
% \end{equation}
% where $q$ is the wave vector for the perturbing mode for the
% relaxation of the amplitude of the contact line and $u_q(0)$ being the
% initial amplitude of the mode. Here, $V^* = \gamma / \eta$ is the
% characteristic velocity and $\theta$ is the contact angle the BLD makes
% with the ice surface ($\sim$ 2 degrees). Lastly, the logarithmic factor
% $l=\mathrm{ln}(L/a)$ is a cutoff parameter which helps avoid
% singularities. From this fit, they obtained $V^* = 2 \pm 1$ m/s, which
% is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of bulk water, 42.21
% m/s.

% Murata \textit{et al.} also investigated the spreading dynamics of the
% BLD-QLLs, during the transformations to TLL-QLLs. The radii of the
% spreading BLD-QLLs were fit to a power law
% \begin{equation}
% r = L (\frac{4S}{3Ll \eta})^{1/4}(t+t_0)^{1/4}.
% \end{equation}
% Here, $S$ is the spreading coefficient, and $t_0$ captures the initial
% state of the droplet. As the QLL transitions from the BLD
% drpolet-shape to the TLL pancake-shape, the volume must be
% conserved. From this conservation, Murata \textit{et al.} estimated
% the thickness of the TLLs as 9 $\pm$ 3 nm.

% Lastly, Murata \textit{et al.} have obtained the characteristic
% velocity of the TLLs in the same way as the BLDs. However, here the
% hydrodynamic dissipation is not located at the wedge of the droplet
% like in the BLD case, but instead the dissipation occurs within the
% fluid of the pancake-shape object itself. Due to this, a slightly
% different expression for the viscious force must be used, and the
% resulting characteristic velocity was found to be $V^* = 0.2 \pm 0.1$
% m/s, about 200 times smaller than that of bulk water. This seems to
% imply a dependence on the characteristic velocity to the QLLs contact
% area and distance from the surface. The BLD droplet-shaped QLLs (where
% the QLL is only partially wets the surface and a larger amount of the
% QLL resides further from the surface), were found to have a
% characteristic velocity of about an order of magnitude larger than the
% more completely wetting state, where more of the QLL resides closer to
% the surface.

% It is interesting to note that the surface tension of the BLD/air
% interface ($\gamma_t$) is approximately equal to the TLL/air interface
% surface tension ($\gamma_b$), as there is observed coexistence of both
% forms of QLLs at the same time. Therefore, the discrepancy in $V^*$
% can be primarily attributed to the shear viscosity of the QLL phase.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter we have presented an investigation of the temperature
dependence of the shear viscosity of the QLL at the basal and
prismatic ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / vapor interfaces.  Recent predictions
by Henson \textit{et al.} claimed that the QLL of ice should behave as
a supercooled bulk liquid at the same temperature.\cite{Henson2005} To
test the validity of these theories, we have performed simulations and
analysis of supercooled bulk liquid water at the same temperatures.

Simulations of exposed basal and prismatic surfaces were performed at
four temperatures of undercooling, and a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) was
observed to form at each of the investigated temperatures. These QLLs
were estimated to be $\sim $~6.7 \AA wide by density measures, in good
agreement with previous work by Conde \textit{et al.}.\cite{Conde2008}
The local tetrahedral order parameter and the local density suggests
that the QLLs are still very structured as compared to the results of
the bulk supercooled liquid. 

Spatially resolved one dimensional diffusion coefficients were
computed, and anisotropic diffusion was observed at all four
temperatures in the prismatic QLL. Conversely, isotropic diffusion was
found at the basal interface. This challenges the upper temperature
limit of anisotropic diffusion reported by Gladich \textit{et al.},
which predicted that by 30 K of undercooling isotropic diffusion
should be recovered.\cite{Gladich2011,Gladich2012}

Lastly, the shear viscosities of the quasi-liquid layers were
reported. We observe a strong distance dependence from the ice / QLL
interface in $\eta$. Close to the ice surface, $\eta_{\mathrm{prism}}$
is found to be larger than $\eta_{\mathrm{basal}}$ at each of the four
temperatures. This agrees well with the solid-liquid friction
coefficients obtained in Chapter \ref{chap:Friction}. Conversely,
close the QLL / vapor interface, no facet dependence is observed, and
the reported values of $\eta$ are roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times smaller
than close to the ice. We conclude that the small friction
coefficients commonly associated with ice surfaces arise from the
small shear viscosity of water molecules at this interface.
