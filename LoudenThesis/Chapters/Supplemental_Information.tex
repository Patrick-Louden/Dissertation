\section{Overview}
The supporting information contains further details about the model
construction, analysis methods, and supplies figures that support the
data presented in the main text.

\section{Fitting velocity profiles}
%%%%% All this goes in SI:
In order to calculate solid-liquid friction coefficients, $\kappa$
from Eq. (5) in the main text, the velocity profiles, $v_x(z)$,
obtained from each shearing simulation were fit assuming linear
behavior through each of the three regions of the simulation box; the
lower liquid, the solid, and the upper liquid. Parabolic functions
were designed to capture the negative slip behavior that links the
three regions,
\begin{equation}\label{vfit}
v(z) =
\begin{cases}
  v_{l} - m_{l}z & 0 \leq z < (z_{1} - w) \\
  v_{s} - \frac{1}{2}k(z-z_{1})^{2} & (z_{1}-w) \leq z < z_{1} \\
  v_{s}  & z_{1} \leq z < z_{2} \\
  v_{s} - \frac{1}{2}k(z-z_{2})^{2}  & z_{2} \leq z <( z_{2} + w)\\
  v_{s} - \frac{1}{2}kw^{2} - m_{l}(z-(z_{2} + w)) & (z_{2} + w) \leq z \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
  
Here, $v_{l}$ is the velocity of the liquid at the middle of the
liquid domain (the edge of the simulation box), and $v_{s}$ is the
velocity of the solid. The locations $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are the edges
of the ice slab, and $w$ is the width of the interface (distinct from
$w_{10-90}$ mentioned in the main text). The parameter $m_{l}$ is the
slope of the velocity profile in the liquid regions of the box which
is related to the liquid-state viscosity. Figure \ref{fig:pyrComic}
shows a representative velocity profile (navy squares) and fit (green
line) with the locations of $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ indicated as vertical
dotted lines. Once the fits were obtained, the values for
$v_{x}(solid)$ and $v_{x}(liquid)$ for Eq. (5) were sampled from the
fit. The $z$ locations used to sample the fit were determined by
structural measures. The $z$ location for $v_{x}(liquid)$ was taken to
be the Gibbs dividing surface of the interface, less the 10$-$90 width
of the interface. Similarly, the $z$ location for $v_{x}(solid)$ was
taken to be the Gibbs dividing surface plus the 10$-$90 width of the
interface.

\section{Dependence of friction on Shear Rate}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{kappaPlot2}
\caption{\label{fig:kappaPlot} Dependence on the observed friction
  coefficient on the shear rate of the ice through the surrounding
  liquid water.  The RNEMD simulations impose a momentum flux, but the
  resulting shear rates can vary.  Here, we collect data in 2 m/s bins
  to accumulate statistics over multiple independent simulations.  The
  SPC/E simulations (solid symbols) were done at 225K, and the
  TIP4P/Ice simulations (patterned symbols) were carried out at
  270K. The points on this plot have also been averaged over shear
  direction ($x$ and $y$).}
\end{figure}

\section{Projected Densities and Channel Widths}

In order to understand the behavior of liquid-phase water molecules
that are directly in contact with the four interfaces, we computed the
mean parallelepiped density,
\begin{equation}
\rho(y, z) = \frac{1}{L_x~dy~dz} \left< \sum_{i = 1}^{N} m_i \delta(y_i - y) \delta(z_i - z)\right>
\end{equation}
for four quiescent interfaces over 1 ns of simulation time (sampled
every ps).  Here, $dy$ and $dz$ are the lengths and widths of a set of
parallelepipeds that span the box depth ($L_x$), and for relatively
small $dy$ and $dz$ (0.05 \AA), the parallelepiped densities show the
smooth transition between the ordered ice facet and the surrounding
liquid.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{DensityPlots}
\caption{\label{fig:DensPlots} Projected densities, $\rho(y, z)$, at
  the four quiescent interfaces.  Darker colors represent higher
  densities, while lighter colors (e.g. white) are relatively
  unpopulated.  For all four interfaces, the location of the
  tetrahedrality Gibbs dividing surface is indicated with a solid
  black line, while the two end points of the 90-10 width are shown in
  grey.}
\end{figure}

We note that the projected densities allow computation of the channel
widths and depth for the two prismatic facets using the locations of
the peak densities.  These figures also indicate that below the Gibbs
dividing surface, almost no liquid state molecules can be found
occupying the channels.

  slab. The vertical dashed line indicates the Gibbs dividing surface
  determined using the local tetrahedral order parameter.  Results are
  shown for a quiescent system with no applied kinetic or momentum
  flux (black), an interface with with an imposed kinetic energy flux
  (red), and a sheared simulation (blue) with both kinetic and
  momentum fluxes.}
