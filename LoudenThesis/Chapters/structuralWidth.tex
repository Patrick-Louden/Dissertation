\chapter{STRUCTURAL WIDTHS OF ICE-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / WATER INTERFACES}
One of the open questions about ice / water interfaces is whether the
thickness of the interfacial `slush' layer depends on the facet of ice
presented to the water. In the interfacial region, the water molecules
are ordered differently than in either the solid or liquid phases, and
also exhibit dynamics unique to their local structure.  The width of
this interfacial layer has been estimated by finding the distance over
which structural order parameters or dynamic properties change from
their bulk liquid values to those of the solid ice. The properties
used to find interfacial widths have included the local density, the
diffusion constant, and both translational and orientational order
parameters~\cite{Karim1988,Karim1990,Hayward2001,Hayward2002,Bryk2002,Gay2002,Louden2013a}. In
this chapter, we focus on structural measures of the ice / water
interface. Dynamic measures are investigated later in Chapter \ref{chap:Dyn}.

\section{Structural Measures of Ice I$_\mathrm{h}$ / Water Interfaces
  Under Shear}\label{structure}
The VSS-RNEMD method employed here creates thermal and velocity
gradients in the system, during which the momenta of the water
molecules are perturbed, thus any order parameters that depends on
translational motion may measure the momentum exchange and not
physical properties of the interface. To avoid these influences, we
have probed the ice / water interface by observing the transition of
several order parameters from their ice to bulk liquid values. 


\subsection{Density Measurements Transverse to the Interface}
Following the pioneering work of Haymet \textit{et al.}, we initially
probed the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface by examining the
transition of the density of molecules from bulk liquid to bulk
ice. Four consecutive 1 ns simulations of quiescent ice / water
systems were performed for each interface. The simulations were
performed under a constant volume and constant energy integrator
(NVE), equilibrated at the coexistence temperature (225~K for SPC/E
and 270~K for TIP4P/Ice) and with no VSS-RNEMD moves attempted
(\textit{i.e.} no thermal or momentum flux applied). During the
simulations, the positions and velocities of the water molecules were
sampled every 0.1 ps.

To compute transverse density profile, each frame of the trajectories
were divided into 0.25~\AA bins, and the average density of each bin
was accumulated. The density profiles were then fit with a hyperbolic
tangent function designed to smoothly transition between the bulk
liquid and ice domains.
\begin{equation}\label{rho_fit}
\rho (z) \approx
\rho_\mathrm{liq}+\frac{\rho_\mathrm{ice}-\rho_\mathrm{liq}}{2}\left[\tanh\left(\frac{z-l}{w^\rho}\right)-\tanh\left(\frac{z-r}{w^\rho}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
Here, $\rho_\mathrm{liq}$ and $\rho_\mathrm{ice}$ are the densities of
the liquid and ice respectively. The $z$-locations of the left and
right Gibbs dividing surfaces are $l$ and $r$, and $w^\rho$ is the
width of the interface. An example density profile for each of the
SPC/E interfaces is shown in Figure \ref{fig:transDensity}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/transDensity}
\caption{\label{fig:transDensity}Transverse density profiles for the
  basal (a), prismatic (b), pyramidal (c) and secondary prism (d)
  facets of an SPC/E ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface (black
  lines). The prismatic and secondary prism profiles are zoomed in to
  show detail at the ice / water interface. The profiles are fit using
  Eq. \eqref{rho_fit} (dashed red lines).}
\end{figure}

From Eq. \eqref{rho_fit}, we have obtained estimates for $w^{\rho}$;
these values are related to the $10\%-90\%$ interfacial widths
commonly reported in previous studies
($w_\mathrm{10-90}^{\rho} = 2.197~w^{\rho}$).\cite{Bryk2002,Bryk2004}
For the SPC/E interfaces at 225~K, we find large discrepencies in
$w_\mathrm{10-90}^{\rho}$ as seen in Table \ref{tab:propsSPCE}.

\begin{table}[h]

\end{table}

For the basal interface, $w_\mathrm{10-90}^{\rho} \sim$ 7 \AA~, where
values closer to 5 \AA~ are observed for the prismatic and secondary
prism interfaces. Lastly, the density transition occurs over $\sim$ 2
\AA~ for the pyramidal interface. Since the pyramidal crystal does not
have well defined crystallographic planes perpendicular to the
dimension normal to the surface, fitting the resulting density
profiles give skewed results. Values for $w_\mathrm{10-90}^{\rho}$ for
the TIP4P/Ice systems are also reported in the same table. While the
interfacial width is observed to be larger for the TIP4P/Ice model,
this is primarily due to the warmer coexistence temperature.XXX

In their initial studies, Karim and Haymet investigated the liquid to
solid transition for a basal ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface
using the TIP4P model at 240~K.\cite{Karim1987,Karim1988} They divided their
system into 0.2 \AA~ bins along the dimension normal to the interface,
and computed the average density for each of these bins. These density
profiles were segmented into 3.7 \AA~bins, which coincide with the
spacing of the crystallographic planes inside their ice crystal. Karim
and Haymet then estimated the width of the basal ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
water interface to be $\sim$ 10 - 15 \AA~ by counting the number of
these wider bins. 



\subsection{Local Tetrahedral Order Parameter}

 As a structural measure of the
interface, we have used the local tetrahedral order parameter, which
compares the local molecular environments (e.g. the angles between
nearest neighbor molecules) to perfect tetrahedral ordering.  This
quantity was originally described by Chau and
Hardwick,~\cite{Chau1998} was rescaled by Errington and
Debenedetti,~\cite{Errington2001} and has been used in bulk liquid
simulations by Kumar \textit{et al.}~\cite{Kumar2009} It has also
previously been used in ice / water interfaces by Bryk and
Haymet~\cite{Bryk2004}, and in our initial work on ice / water
interfaces\cite{Louden2013a}.

We have evaluated the local tetrahedral order parameter, $q$, along
the coordinate perpendicular to the ice / water interface, i.e., the
$z$-axis of the simulation box. With $N$ molecules,
\begin{equation}
q(z) = \frac{1}{N_z} \int_0^L \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Bigg(1 -\frac{9}{2n(n-1)}\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}
\sum_{k=j+1}^{n} \bigg(\cos\psi_{jik}+\frac{1}{3}\bigg)^2\Bigg)
\delta(z_{i}-z)\mathrm{d}z .
\label{eq:qz}
\end{equation}
$\psi_{jik}$ is the angle formed between the oxygen sites of water
molecules $i$, $j$, and $k$, where molecule $i$ is the central water
molecule (with $n$ neighbors) and molecules $j$ and $k$ are two of the
neighbors of $i$.  The neighboring molecules $j$ and $k$ are
restricted to lie within the first solvation shell of molecule $i$
($r < 3.41$~\AA\ for water), and the double sum visits all angles for
the $n$ neighbors of molecule $i$ that are within this distance.  When
molecule $i$ has exactly four neighbors ($n=4$), the prefactor reduces
to $3/8$, as in the expression of Errington and Debenedetti, but
Eq. \eqref{eq:qz} also provides tetrahedrality information for water
molecules that are either under- or over-coordinated. We have also
introduced the normalization factor
$N_z = \sum_i \int \delta(z_i - z) \mathrm{d}z$ to account for the
varying populations of water molecules within each finite-width bin.

At low temperatures, the tetrahedral order parameter can approach
unity for perfect ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ structures. However, at
temperatures close to melting, values of 0.9 are more common in SPC/E
ice due to thermal motion in the lattice. In the liquid, overlap of
the local environment with a perfect tetrahedron is reduced, and
values of $q(z) \approx 0.75$ are common in SPC/E water at 225~K. The
results indicate more tetrahedral structure in TIP4P/Ice; at
270~K, tetrahedrality averages, $q(z) \approx 0.95$ and $0.75$ are
found in the ice and liquid, respectively.

The structural widths of the ice / water interfaces were determined by
dividing each system into 1~\AA~ bins along the $z$-axis, and
computing statistical averages of $q(z)$ in each bin. For the
secondary prism interface (using SPC/E water at 225~K), the resulting
distribution can be seen in the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig:spComic}
(and in the Supporting Information for the other interfaces and
TIP4P/Ice). In the bulk liquid (at small and large values of $z$), the
order parameter takes on values of $q(z) \approx~0.77$, while
$q(z) \approx~0.92$ was found in bins spanning the ice. The
tetrahedrality profiles were fit using a function that captures the
smooth transition from the bulk liquid to ice (turquoise line in the
bottom panel of the same figures),
\begin{equation}\label{tet_fit}
q(z) \approx
q_\mathrm{liq}+\frac{q_\mathrm{ice}-q_\mathrm{liq}}{2}\left[\tanh\left(\frac{z-l}{w^q}\right)-\tanh\left(\frac{z-r}{w^q}\right)\right]+\beta\left|z-\frac{r+l}{2}\right|.
\end{equation}
Here $q_\mathrm{liq}$ and $q_\mathrm{ice}$ are the values of the order
parameter for the bulk liquid and ice domains. The locations $l$ and
$r$ are the $z-$coordinates of the Gibbs dividing surface for the left
and right interfaces (shown in Fig. \ref{fig:spComic} with vertical
dotted lines), and $w^{q}$ is the interfacial width.  The last term in
Eq. \eqref{tet_fit} accounts for the influence of the weak thermal
gradient on the tetrahedrality profile in the liquid region. Namely,
at warmer temperatures the liquid is able to adopt local
configurations resulting in lower values of the order parameter. This
results in a small linear decay in the tetrahedrality profiles for
increasing displacements from the ice surface.

  required to maintain a fixed interfacial temperature of $\sim$225 K

  gradient (squares) that develops in response to an imposed momentum

  indicate the locations of the Gibbs dividing surfaces of the two
  interfaces.}
\end{figure}

In the middle panel of Fig. \ref{fig:spComic}, we show the resulting
thermal gradient from the imposed kinetic energy flux. For the SPC/E
water model, the interfacial temperature is held at $\sim$ 225~K
(270~K for the TIP4P/Ice), allowing investigation of the response to
the shear while maintaining solid / liquid coexistence. In the top
panel, the velocity gradient resulting from the imposed momentum flux
shows that the ice has a uniform positive velocity along the $x$
axis. The bulk liquid at the ends of the simulation cell has negative
velocity, although the center of mass of the simulation box is
stationary.  The bulk fluid shows a primarily linear velocity gradient
allowing for easy calculation of the shear viscosity using
Eq. \eqref{eq:viscosity}. Close to the interface, the ice imparts
significant positive momentum into the surrounding interfacial liquid.
Projections of the velocity gradient from the liquid onto the Gibbs
dividing surface indicate that the ice-water interface is in the
negative slip regime. For comparison, Figure \ref{fig:tipsComic} shows
the secondary prism interface for the TIP4P/Ice system.

  dividing surfaces of the two interfaces.}
\end{figure}

From Eq. \eqref{tet_fit}, we have obtained estimates for $w^{q}$, the
structural widths of the interfaces for the quiescent ice / water
systems. These values are related to the $10\%-90\%$ interfacial
widths commonly reported in previous studies
($w_\mathrm{10-90}^{q} = 2.197~w^{q}$).\cite{Bryk2002,Bryk2004} For the
SPC/E interfaces at 225~K, we find
$w_\mathrm{10-90}^{q} \approx 7$~\AA~ as seen in Table
\ref{tab:propsSPCE}. These values are similar to our previous findings
for the $10\%-90\%$ interfacial widths obtained from shorter
simulations, ($7.0 \pm 0.9$ \AA) for basal and ($7.9 \pm 0.4$ \AA) for
prismatic interfaces.\cite{Louden2013a} The interfacial widths in
TIP4P/Ice systems indicate slightly broader interfaces, where values
of $w_\mathrm{10-90}^{q} \approx 9$~\AA~ are more common. These values
are also reported in Table \ref{tab:propsSPCE}.

Over the range of shear rates investigated,
$\sim 0.5-10.0~\mathrm{~m~s}^{-1}$, we find no significant changes in
the interfacial widths for any of the crystal faces (see Fig. \ref{fig:tetByShearRate}). All values of
$w_\mathrm{10-90}^{q}$ obtained from shearing simulations fell inside the
error bars of the values obtained from the quiescent simulations.

  parameter fit by Eq. \eqref{tet_fit}.}
\end{figure}



These values agree reasonably well with those reported by Haymet
\textit{et
  al.}.\cite{Karim1988,Karim1990,Hayward2001,Bryk2002,Hayward2002,Bryk2004}
Using a variety of water models and several different order
parameters, they have estimated the ice / water interface to be
between $5$~\AA~and $18$~\AA~depending on the particular interface and
means of measure.  For the SPC/E model, they found the basal and
prismatic ice / water interface to be $\approx 11$~\AA~ wide from
translational and window-averaged density order parameters. The
interfacial widths were also estimated by observing the transition of
a similar tetrahedral order parameter from their ice-like value of
$0.9$ to the bulk liquid value of $0.6$. This gave estimates of
$\approx 11$~\AA~, somewhat larger than our current estimates. More
careful analysis will be necessary to determine if the proton striped
surface configurations used here are the origin of this discrepancy.
