  INTERFACES}\label{chap:Str}

One of the open questions about ice / water interfaces is whether the
thickness of the interfacial `slush' layer depends on the facet of ice
presented to the water. In the interfacial region, the water molecules
are ordered differently than in either the solid or liquid phases, and
also exhibit dynamics unique to their local structure.  The width of
this interfacial layer has been estimated by finding the distance over
which structural order parameters or dynamic properties change from
their bulk liquid values to those of the solid ice. The properties
used to find interfacial widths have included the local density, the
diffusion constant, and both translational and orientational order
parameters~\cite{Karim1988,Karim1990,Hayward2001,Hayward2002,Bryk2002,Gay2002,Louden2013a}. Throughout
shearing simulations, the VSS-RNEMD method employed here creates
thermal and velocity gradients in the system, during which the momenta
of the water molecules are perturbed. Due to this, any order parameters that
depends on translational motion may measure the momentum exchange and
not physical properties of the interface. To avoid these influences,
we have probed the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface under shear by
observing the transition of several order parameters independent of
momenta from their ice to bulk liquid values.  In this chapter, we
focus on structural order parameters for measurements of interfacial
width, and consider dynamic order parameters in Chapter
\ref{chap:Dyn}.

\section{Density Measurements Transverse to the Interface}
One of the many anomolies of water is that under ambient conditions
the density of the solid is less than that of the liquid. The
tetrahedral structure of ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ is more open than the
local solvation environment of the liquid, which gives rise to this
phenomena. Liquid water at the surface of ice would experience two
different environments on either side of the molecule; ice-like
templating from the exposed solid and liquid-like packing on the
other. Due to this, the liquid may take on a configuration that is
unique to its local environment, and this deviation from bulk
liquid-like structures may take several molecular layers to dampen
out. Therefore it may be possible to quantify the transition between
the solid and the bulk liquid by observing the length scale over which
these effects diminish.

In order to understand what affect shearing has on the structure of
water at the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface, we initially
studied the systems without imposed thermal or momentum
fluxes. Following the pioneering work of Haymet \textit{et al.}, we
probed the interface by examining the transition of the density of
molecules from bulk liquid to bulk
ice.\cite{Karim1987,Karim1990,Hayward2001,Bryk2004} Four consecutive 1
ns simulations of quiescent ice / water systems were performed for
each exposed crystal face. These simulations were performed under a
constant volume and constant energy integrator (NVE), equilibrated at
the coexistence temperature (225~K for SPC/E and 270~K for
TIP4P/Ice). During the simulations, the positions of the water
molecules were sampled every 0.1 ps.

To compute transverse density profiles, each frame of the trajectories
were divided into 0.25~\AA~bins, and the average density of each bin
was accumulated. The density profiles were then fit with a hyperbolic
tangent function designed to smoothly transition between the bulk
liquid and ice domains. Following Haymet \textit{et al.}, only the
density maximas corresponding to the planes of ice were included in
the data in the ice regions.
\begin{equation}\label{rho_fit}
\rho (z) \approx
\rho_\mathrm{liq}+\frac{\rho_\mathrm{ice}-\rho_\mathrm{liq}}{2}\left[\tanh\left(\frac{z-l}{w^\rho}\right)-\tanh\left(\frac{z-r}{w^\rho}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
Here, $\rho_\mathrm{liq}$ and $\rho_\mathrm{ice}$ are the densities of
the liquid and ice respectively. The $z$-locations of the left and
right Gibbs dividing surfaces are $l$ and $r$, and $w^\rho$ is the
width of the interface. An example density profile for each of the
SPC/E interfaces is shown in Figure \ref{fig:transDensity} (a similar
set of graphs for the TIP4P-Ice modeled systems can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:TIPtransDensity} in Appendix \ref{structAppendix}).

\begin{figure*}

  lines). The prismatic and secondary prism profiles are zoomed in to
  show detail at the ice / water interface. The profiles are fit using
  Equation \eqref{rho_fit} (dashed red lines).}
\end{figure*}

From Equation \eqref{rho_fit}, we have obtained estimates for
$w^{\rho}$; these values are related to the $10\%-90\%$ interfacial
widths commonly reported in previous studies
($w_\mathrm{10-90}^{\rho} = 2.197~w^{\rho}$).\cite{Bryk2002,Bryk2004}
The results for the SPC/E and TIP4P/Ice interfaces are reported in
Table \ref{tab:strWidths}.

\end{table}

For the SPC/E basal, prismatic, and secondary prism interfaces, we
estimate an interfacial width $w_\mathrm{10-90}^{\rho} \sim$ 8
\AA~. However, the solid to liquid density transition for the
14\degree~pyramidal interface is observed to occur over $\sim$ 3
\AA~. This result suggests the transition from ice to liquid water
occurs over a single molecular diameter for the pyramidal interface,
while over several molecular diameters for the other ice facets. Since
the 14\degree~pyramidal crystal does not have well defined
crystallographic planes perpendicular to the dimension normal to the
surface, fitting the resulting density profiles gives potentially
skewed results. A similar trend is observed in the TIP4P/Ice estimates
of $w_\mathrm{10-90}^{\rho}$. The basal and two prismatic interfaces
are found to be of similar width, although slightly broader than those
predicted by SPC/E. This can be attributed to the warmer coexistence
temperature of the TIP4P/Ice model. However, the pyramidal width
appears to suffer from the same issue as in the SPC/E fits.  Since the
density profiles (black lines) require subjective fitting (red
dashed-lines) and the resulting estimates of the interfacial widths
using this metric are faulty for certain orientations of the crystal,
it is desirable to consider a second structural order parameter for
comparison.

\section{Local Tetrahedral Order Parameter}\label{sec:tetra}
As a second structural measure of the interface, we have used the
local tetrahedral order parameter, which compares the local molecular
environments (e.g. the angles between nearest neighbor molecules) to
perfect tetrahedral ordering. This method would not be skewed due to
rotations of the crystal, and would therefore more accurately quantify
the transition of the local structure through the interface. This
quantity was originally described by Chau and
Hardwick,~\cite{Chau1998} was rescaled by Errington and
Debenedetti,~\cite{Errington2001} and has been used in bulk liquid
simulations by Kumar \textit{et al.}~\cite{Kumar2009}, and at ice /
water interfaces by Bryk and Haymet~\cite{Bryk2004}.

We have evaluated the local tetrahedral order parameter, $q$, along
the coordinate perpendicular to the ice / water interface,
\textit{i.e}., the $z$-axis of the simulation box. With $N$ total molecules,
\begin{equation}
q(z) = \frac{1}{N_z} \int_0^L \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Bigg(1 -\frac{9}{2n(n-1)}\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}
\sum_{k=j+1}^{n} \bigg(\cos\psi_{jik}+\frac{1}{3}\bigg)^2\Bigg)
\delta(z_{i}-z)\mathrm{d}z .
\label{eq:qz}
\end{equation}
$\psi_{jik}$ is the angle formed between the oxygen sites of water
molecules $i$, $j$, and $k$, where molecule $i$ is the central water
molecule (with $n$ neighbors) and molecules $j$ and $k$ are two of the
neighbors of $i$.  The neighboring molecules $j$ and $k$ are
restricted to lie within the first solvation shell of molecule $i$
($r < 3.41$~\AA\ for water), and the double sum visits all angles for
the $n$ neighbors of molecule $i$ that are within this distance.  When
molecule $i$ has exactly four neighbors ($n=4$), the prefactor reduces
to $3/8$, as in the expression of Errington and Debenedetti, but
Equation \eqref{eq:qz} also provides tetrahedrality information for water
molecules that are either under- or over-coordinated. We have also
introduced the normalization factor
$N_z = \sum_i \int \delta(z_i - z) \mathrm{d}z$ to account for the
varying populations of water molecules within each finite-width bin.

At low temperatures, the tetrahedral order parameter can approach
unity for perfect ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ structures. However, at
temperatures close to melting, values of 0.9 are more common in SPC/E
ice due to thermal motion in the lattice. In the liquid, overlap of
the local environment with a perfect tetrahedron is reduced, and
values of $q(z) \approx 0.75$ are common in SPC/E water at 225~K. The
results indicate more tetrahedral structure in TIP4P/Ice; at
270~K, tetrahedrality averages, $q(z) \approx 0.95$ and $0.75$ are
found in the ice and liquid, respectively.

The structural widths of the ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interfaces
were determined by dividing each system into 1~\AA~ bins along the
$z$-axis, and computing statistical averages of $q(z)$ in each
bin. For the secondary prism interface (using SPC/E water at 225~K),
the resulting distribution can be seen in the bottom panel of
Figure \ref{fig:spComic} and for comparison, Figure \ref{fig:tipsComic}
shows the same interface using the TIP4P/Ice model at 270~K.  (See
Appendix \ref{structAppendix} for the other interfaces with the SPC/E
and TIP4P/Ice models). In the bulk liquid (at small and large values
of $z$) of Figure \ref{fig:spComic}, the order parameter takes on values
of $q(z) \approx~0.77$, while $q(z) \approx~0.92$~was found in bins
spanning the ice. The tetrahedrality profiles were fit using the same
functional form as the density profiles, however, an additive term was
included to account for the change in tetrahedral ordering due to the
thermal gradient throughout the system for simulations where thermal
fluxes were applied (turquoise line in the bottom panel of the same
figures),
\begin{equation}\label{tet_fit}
q(z) \approx
q_\mathrm{liq}+\frac{q_\mathrm{ice}-q_\mathrm{liq}}{2}\left[\tanh\left(\frac{z-l}{w^q}\right)-\tanh\left(\frac{z-r}{w^q}\right)\right]+\beta\left|z-\frac{r+l}{2}\right|.
\end{equation}
Here $q_\mathrm{liq}$ and $q_\mathrm{ice}$ are the values of the order
parameter for the bulk liquid and ice domains. The locations $l$ and
$r$ are the $z-$coordinates of the Gibbs dividing surface for the left
and right interfaces (shown in Figure \ref{fig:spComic} with vertical
dotted lines), and $w^{q}$ is the interfacial width.  The last term in
Equation \eqref{tet_fit} accounts for the influence of the weak thermal
gradient on the tetrahedrality profile in the liquid region. Namely,
at warmer temperatures the liquid is able to adopt local
configurations resulting in lower values of the order parameter. This
results in a small linear decay in the tetrahedrality profiles for
increasing displacements from the ice surface.

  dividing surfaces of the two interfaces.}
\end{figure*}

In the middle panel of Figure \ref{fig:spComic}, we show the resulting
thermal gradient from the imposed kinetic energy flux. For the SPC/E
systems, the interfacial temperature is held at $\sim$ 225~K
(270~K for the TIP4P/Ice), allowing investigation of the response to
the shear while maintaining solid / liquid coexistence. In the top
panel, the velocity gradient resulting from the imposed momentum flux
shows that the ice has a uniform positive velocity along the
$x$-axis. The bulk liquid at the ends of the simulation cell has
negative velocity, although the center of mass of the simulation box
is stationary.  The bulk fluid shows a primarily linear velocity
gradient allowing for easy calculation of the shear viscosity using
Equation \eqref{eq:viscosity}. Close to the interface, the ice imparts
significant positive momentum into the surrounding interfacial liquid.
Projections of the velocity gradient from the liquid onto the Gibbs
dividing surface indicate that the ice / water interface is in the
negative slip regime. 

From Equation \eqref{tet_fit}, we have obtained estimates for $w^{q}$,
which can be related to the $10\%-90\%$ interfacial widths in the same
way as $w^{\rho}$
($w_\mathrm{10-90}^{q} = 2.197~w^{q}$).\cite{Bryk2002,Bryk2004} For
each of the SPC/E interfaces at 225~K, we find
$w_\mathrm{10-90}^{q} \approx 7$~\AA~ as seen in Table
\ref{tab:strWidths}. The interfacial widths in TIP4P/Ice systems
indicate slightly broader interfaces, where values of
$w_\mathrm{10-90}^{q} \approx 9$~\AA~ are more common. These values
are also reported in Table \ref{tab:strWidths}. 

Over the range of shear rates investigated,
$\sim 0.5-10.0~\mathrm{~m~s}^{-1}$, we find no significant changes in
the interfacial widths for any of the crystal faces (see Figure \ref{fig:tetByShearRate}). All values of
$w_\mathrm{10-90}^{q}$ obtained from shearing simulations fell inside the
error bars of the values obtained from the quiescent simulations.

  Equation \eqref{tet_fit}.}

\section{Discussion}
While there has been a considerable number of computational and
experimental investigations on the ice / vapor
interface\cite{Bolton2000,Conde2008,Gladich2011,Sazaki2011,Pfalzgraff2011,Watkins2011,Bartels-Rausch2014,Gladich2015,Murata2015,Asakawa2016,Benet2016,Murata2016,Neshyba2016,Limmer2016,Michaelides2017,Sancheza2017},
significantly fewer studies have been reported at the ice / liquid
interface. \cite{Beaglehole1980,Karim1988,Karim1990,Hayward2001,Hayward2002,Bryk2002,Gay2002}
Due to the difficulty of experimentally probing water's properties at
the bulk liquid / solid interface, most of what is known has been
provided by computational methods. However, there is disagreement
amongst the community as to which water model is best suited for
studying these
interfaces\cite{Sanz2004a,Vega2005c,Abascal2007,Vega2009}, as well as
the coexistence temperatures for these
models.\cite{Gao2000,Bryk2004,Sanz2004a,Vega2006a,Abascal2007,Paesani2016}
Slight changes in the treatment of the long range electrostatic
interactions have been seen to significantly alter the coexistence
temperature.\cite{Bryk2004} This has resulted in a collection of data
points for the properties of water molecules at the ice / water
interface, many with different models, electrostatic treatment, and at
varying temperatures.

In the late 1980's, Karim and Haymet investigated the solid to liquid
transition for a basal ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface using the
TIP4P model at 240~K~\cite{Karim1987,Karim1988}, and the SPC model at
200~K.\cite{Karim1990} In each of the studies, they computed the
average density along the dimension normal to the interface, and
binned the resulting profiles to coincide with the
spacing of the crystallographic planes inside their ice crystal. Karim
and Haymet then estimated the width of the basal ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ /
water interface to be $\sim$ 10 \AA~ - 15 \AA~ by counting the number of
these large bins. This result proved to be invarient of the exposed
surface area of the basal plane.

Around the same time, Nada and Furukawa observed a slight anisotropy
between the basal and prismatic ice / water interface using the TIP4P
model at 230~K.\cite{Nada1995} Their primary method for discriminating
ice-like and liquid-like molecules was the local density, as well as
an existence function which determined the likelihood that a water
molecule had four nearest neighbors. They estimated the ice / water
interface to be between 9 \AA~ and 12 \AA~ wide, with the basal
interface being slightly narrower than the prismatic.

Our density based estimates for the basal and prismatic
ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interfaces agrees well with those by Haymet
\textit{et al.} and Nada \textit{et al.}. We did not observe the same
anisotropy as Nada and Furukawa, however, our fit resolution was much
larger, and their results could have been an artificat of their larger
binning method. 

The problem of ice / water coexistence was later revisited by Hayward
and Haymet, where a comparitive study of the basal, prism,
14\degree~pyramidal, and $\{2\bar{1}\bar{1}0\}$ secondary prism
ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interfaces was conducted.\cite{Hayward2001}
This was the first computer investigation of the 14\degree~pyramidal,
and $\{2\bar{1}\bar{1}0\}$ secondary prism ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water
interfaces, providing the initial insights to the structure and
dynamics of molecules at these higher-order crystal facet
interfaces. % These two interfaces were found to be of particular
% interest as Type 1 antifreeze proteins in both winter flounder and
% shorthorn Sculpin inhibit ice growth at these ice
% surfaces.\cite{Knight2001,Wierzbicki1996,Haymet1998,Harding1999}
They observed a stable ice / water interface at 270~K over 300 ps
using the CF1 central force model, and estimated the $10\%-90\%$ width
of the interfaces by measuring the transition of two structural
criteria, the translational order and a Gaussian filtered
translational order (see Table \ref{tab:structCompare}). Their
calculations indicate that the basal and prismatic interfaces are
wider than the two higher index facets. While we did not see this
trend, our results for the basal and prismatic interfaces using the
TIP4P/Ice water model agree well with their estimates given by the
translational order parameter. Our simulations with the SPC/E model
predict a slightly thinner interface, possibly due to the colder
coexistence temperature. Lastly, their estimates of interfacial width
from the average density predicts a much wider interface, with
estimates roughly a factor of 2 larger than those computed by the
unfiltered translational order parameter. It is unclear if the
filtering process provides a more accurate measure, much of the
observed difference can be attributed to how the Gaussian filtering
process broadens out the transition between the bulk ice and bulk
liquid domains.
 

% For each order
% parameter studied, the systems were divided into $\sim$3 \AA~ bins
% along the dimension normal to the interface (chosen here to be along
% the $z$-axis), and the average of the parameter was computed for each
% bin. A Gaussian filter was then applied to the Fourier transofrm of
% the resulting order parameter profile. For example, for the
% translational order profile $\rho (z)$,
% \begin{equation}
% g(k) = \int_{-n}^{n} \mathrm{exp}(-2\pi ikz)\rho (z)dz
% \end{equation}
% where $n$ is half of the box length in the direction normal to the
% interface. The oscillations in $g(k)$ are then dampened with the
% Gaussian filter,
% \begin{equation}
% g'(k) = g(k)\mathrm{wt}(k)
% \end{equation}
% where 
% \begin{equation}
% \mathrm{wt}(k)=\frac{1}{\sigma_{k}\sqrt{2\pi }}~\mathrm{exp}\Bigg(-\frac{1}{2\sigma_{k}^{2}}k^{2}\Bigg).
% \end{equation}
% Here, $2\sigma_{k}$ defines the resolution of the Gaussian. Inverse
% Fourier transform of $g'(k)$ gives the filtered translational order
% profile, $\rho '(z)$
% \begin{equation}
% \rho '(z) = \int_{-n}^{n} \mathrm{exp}(2\pi ikz)g'(k)dk
% \end{equation}
% which can be written as a convolution integral
% \begin{equation}
% \rho '(z) = \int_{-n}^{n} \mathrm{wt}'(z-z')\rho (z')dz'
% \end{equation}
% where
% \begin{equation}
% \mathrm{wt}'(z-z') = \frac{1}{\sigma
%   \sqrt{2\pi}}~\mathrm{exp}\Bigg(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}(z-z')^{2}\Bigg)
% \end{equation}
% and the value of $\sigma$ is chosen such that $\rho '(z)$ is flat in
% the bulk ice region. This method of filtering the binned order
% parameter data ensures the profile smoothly varies from bulk ice to
% bulk liquid through the interface.  The filtered order parameter
% profiles were then averaged about the midpoint of the system, and fit
% by
% \begin{equation}
% \rho (z) = \rho_{l}[1-f(z)]+\rho_{s}f(z)
% \end{equation}
% where
% \begin{equation}
% f(z) = \frac{1}{2}\Bigg[1-\mathrm{tanh}\Big(\frac{z-z_{0}}{w}\Big)\Bigg]
% \end{equation}
% here, $\rho_{l}$ and $\rho_{s}$are the bulk densities of the liquid
% and solid, $z_0$ is the midpoint of the interface, and $w$ can be
% related to the 10-90 with of the interface through
% $w_{10-90} = 2.1971\times w$. When substitutions are made, the
% resulting expression is similar to Equation \eqref{rho_fit}.
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:Hayward2001}
% \rho (z) = \rho_{l} + \frac{\rho_{s} -
%   \rho_{l}}{2}\Bigg[1-\mathrm{tanh}\bigg(\frac{z-z_0}{w}\bigg)\Bigg]
% \end{equation}

% From Equation \eqref{eq:Hayward2001}, 
Hayward and Haymet estimated the $10\%-90\%$ widths of the
ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface for the translational profiles
and the average density profiles (see Table
\ref{tab:structCompare}). Their calculations indicate that the basal
and prismatic interfaces are wider than that of the two higher index
facets. While we did not see this trend, our results for the basal and
prismatic interfaces using the TIP4P/Ice water model agree well with
their estimates given by the translational order parameter. Our
simulations with the SPC/E model predict a slightly thinner interface,
possibly due to the colder coexistence temperature. Lastly, their
estimates of interfacial width from the average density predicts a
much wider interface, with estimates roughly a factor of 2 larger than
those computed by the unfiltered translational order parameter. It is
unclear if the filtering process provides a more accurate measure,
much of the observed difference can be attributed to how the Gaussian
filtering process broadens out the transition between the bulk ice and
bulk liquid domains.

% In a follow up paper, Hayward and Haymet studied the orientational
% ordering of water molecules transverse to the interface as an
% additional order parameter.\cite{Hayward2002} They computed the
% time-averaged one-body orientational correlation functions for the
% angle made between the origin of the simulation cell and the HOH
% bisector, $\theta$, as well as the angle made with the projection of
% the HOH bisector with the plane of the system, $\phi$.

Using the SPC/E model, Bryk and Haymet estimated interfacial widths
for the basal and prismatic faces by observing the transition of a
similar tetrahedral order parameter from the ice-like value of $0.9$
to a bulk liquid value of $0.6$.\cite{Bryk2004} This resulted in widths of
$\sim$ 11~\AA~, somewhat larger than our current estimates. While
the oxygen atoms of the presented surface facets are identical to
those used in our investigation, the surface hydrogen placement was
vastly different than ours. Our ice surfaces were designed to
replicate proton striping observed by Buch \textit{et al.} to
replicate sum-frequency generation experiments by Shultz \textit{et
  al.}.  More careful analysis will be necessary to determine if the
proton striped surface configurations used here are the origin of this
discrepancy.


\section{Summary}
In this chapter we have presented structural analyses of the basal,
prismatic, 14\degree~ pyramidal, and secondary prism facets of an
ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface. Fitting the local density
profiles predicted a $10\%-90\%$ interfacial width of $\sim$ 8 \AA~
for the basal and two prismatic facets. However, the same fits
predicted a much narrower interface for the pyramidal facet, believed
to be due to the rotation of the crystal. Fitting these density
profiles required biasing the density maxima within the ice, therefore
a second order parameter was considered. The local tetrahedral order
parameter is a more accurate measure of liquid-like and ice-like
configurations, and fits of the order parameter gave estimates of
interfacial width with smaller error. For each of the facets, the
SPC/E ice-I$_\mathrm{h}$ / water interface was found to be $\sim$ 7
\AA~ wide, while the slightly warmer TIP4P/Ice interface was predicted
to be $\sim$ 9 \AA~ wide. These widths were found to be insensitive to
shear rate, indicating that the interface is quite stable under flow.
