abstract = {On the surface of water ice, a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) has been extensively reported at temperatures below its bulk melting point at 273 K. Approaching the bulk melting temperature from below, the thickness of the QLL is known to increase. To elucidate the precise temperature variation of the QLL, and its nature, we investigate the surface melting of hexagonal ice by combining noncontact, surface-specific vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and spectra calculated from molecular dynamics simulations. Using SFG, we probe the outermost water layers of distinct single crystalline ice faces at different temperatures. For the basal face, a stepwise, sudden weakening of the hydrogen-bonded structure of the outermost water layers occurs at 257 K. The spectral calculations from the molecular dynamics simulations reproduce the experimental findings; this allows us to interpret our experimental findings in terms of a stepwise change from one to two molten bilayers at the transition temperature.},

In this work, we use molecular dynamics and two advanced sampling techniques, forward flux sampling and umbrella sampling, to study homogeneous nucleation of ice in free-standing thin films of supercooled water. We use a coarse-grained mono-atomic model of water, known as mW, and we find that in this model a vapor–liquid interface sup-presses crystallization in its vicinity. This suppression occurs in the vicinity of flat interfaces where no net Laplace pressure in induced. Our free energy calculations reveal that the pre-critical crystalline nuclei that emerge near the interface are thermodynamically less stable than those that emerge in the bulk. We investigate the origin of this instability by computing the average asphericity of nuclei that form in different regions of the film, and observe that average asphericity increases closer to the interface, which is consistent with an increase in the free energy due to increased surface-to-volume ratios.},

abstract = {There is overwhelming evidence that ions are present near the vapor-liquid interface of aqueous salt solutions. Charged groups can also be driven to interfaces by attaching them to hydrophobic moieties. Despite their importance in many self-assembly phenomena, how ion-ion interactions are affected by interfaces is not understood. We use molecular simulations to show that the effective forces between small ions change character dramatically near the water vapor-liquid interface. Specifically, the water-mediated attraction between oppositely charged ions is enhanced relative to that in bulk water. Further, the repulsion between like-charged ions is weaker than that expected from a continuum dielectric description and can even become attractive as the ions are drawn to the vapor side. We show that thermodynamics of ion association are governed by a delicate balance of ion hydration, interfacial tension, and restriction of capillary fluctuations at the interface, leading to nonintuitive phenomena, such as water-mediated like charge attraction. "Sticky" electrostatic interactions may have important consequences on biomolecular structure, assembly, and aggregation at soft liquid interfaces. We demonstrate this by studying an interfacially active model peptide that changes its structure from $\alpha$-helical to a hairpin-turn-like one in response to charging of its ends.},

abstract = {The central role played by water in fundamental processes relevant to different disciplines, including chemistry, physics, biology, materials science, geology, and climate research, cannot be overemphasized. It is thus not surprising that, since the pioneering work by Stillinger and Rahman, many theoretical and computational studies have attempted to develop a microscopic description of the unique properties of water under different thermodynamic conditions. Consequently, numerous molecular models based on either molecular mechanics or ab initio approaches have been proposed over the years. However, despite continued progress, the correct prediction of the properties of water from small gas-phase clusters to the liquid phase and ice through a single molecular model remains challenging. To large extent, this is due to the difficulties encountered in the accurate modeling of the underlying hydrogen-bond network in which both number and strength of the hydrogen bonds vary continuously as a result of a subtle interplay between energetic, entropic, and nuclear quantum effects. In the past decade, the development of efficient algorithms for correlated electronic structure calculations of small molecular complexes, accompanied by tremendous progress in the analytical representation of multidimensional potential energy surfaces, opened the doors to the design of highly accurate potential energy functions built upon rigorous representations of the many-body expansion (MBE) of the interaction energies. This Account provides a critical overview of the performance of the MB-pol many-body potential energy function through a systematic analysis of energetic, structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties as well as of vibrational spectra of water from the gas to the condensed phase. It is shown that MB-pol achieves unprecedented accuracy across all phases of water through a quantitative description of each individual term of the MBE, with a physically correct representation of both short- and long-range many-body contributions. Comparisons with experimental data probing different regions of the water potential energy surface from clusters to bulk demonstrate that MB-pol represents a major step toward the long-sought-after "universal model" capable of accurately describing the molecular properties of water under different conditions and in different environments. Along this path, future challenges include the extension of the many-body scheme adopted by MB-pol to the description of generic solutes as well as the integration of MB-pol in an efficient theoretical and computational framework to model acid-base reactions in aqueous environments. In this context, given the nontraditional form of the MB-pol energy and force expressions, synergistic efforts by theoretical/computational chemists/physicists and computer scientists will be critical for the development of high-performance software for many-body molecular dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the hydrophobicity of chemically heterogeneous surfaces may present important nonlinearities as a function of composition. In this article, this issue is systematically explored using molecular simulations. The hydrophobicity is characterized by computing the contact angle of water on flat interfaces and the desorption pressure of water from cylindrical nanopores. The studied interfaces are binary mixtures of hydrophilic and hydrophobic sites, with and without the ability to form hydrogen bonds with water, intercalated at different scales. Water is described with the mW coarse-grained potential, where hydrogen-bonds are modeled in the absence of explicit hydrogen atoms, via a three-body term that favors tetrahedral coordination. We found that the combination of particles exhibiting the same kind of coordination with water gives rise to a linear dependence of contact angle with respect to composition, in agreement with the Cassie model. However, when only the hydrophilic component can form hydrogen bonds, unprecedented deviations from linearity are observed, increasing the contact angle and the vapor pressure above their values in the purely hydrophobic interface. In particular, the maximum enhancement is seen when a 35{\%} of hydrogen bonding molecules is randomly scattered on a hydrophobic background. This effect is very sensitive to the heterogeneity length-scale, being significantly attenuated when the hydrophilic domains reach a size of 2 nm. The observed behavior may be qualitatively rationalized via a simple modification of the Cassie model, by assuming a different microrugosity for hydrogen bonding and non-hydrogen bonding interfaces.},

abstract = {Ice crystals in the atmosphere nucleate from supercooled liquid water and grow by vapor uptake. The structure of the ice polymorph grown has strong impact on the morphology and light scattering of the ice crystals, modulates the amount of water vapor in ice clouds, and can impact the molecular uptake and reactivity of atmospheric aerosols. Experiments and molecular simulations indicate that ice nucleated and grown from deeply supercooled liquid water is metastable stacking disordered ice. The ice polymorph grown from vapor has not yet been determined. Here we use large- scale molecular simulations to determine the structure of ice that grows as a result of uptake of water vapor in the temperature range relevant to cirrus and mixed-phase clouds, elucidate the molecular mechanism of the formation of ice at the vapor interface, and compute the free energy difference between cubic and hexagonal ice interfaces with vapor. We find that vapor deposition results in growth of stacking disordered ice only under conditions of extreme supersaturation, for which a nonequilibrium liquid layer completely wets the surface of ice. Such extreme conditions have been used to produce stacking disordered frost ice in experiments and may be plausible in the summer polar mesosphere. Growth of ice from vapor at moderate supersaturations in the temperature range relevant to cirrus and mixed- phase clouds, from 200 to 260 K, produces exclusively the stable hexagonal ice polymorph. Cubic ice is disfavored with respect to hexagonal ice not only by a small penalty in the bulk free energy (3.6 ± 1.5 J mol−1 at 260 K) but also by a large free energy penalty at the ice−vapor interface (89.7 ± 12.8 J mol−1 at 260 K). The latter originates in higher vibrational entropy of the hexagonal-terminated ice−vapor interface. We predict that the free energy penalty against the cubic ice interface should decrease strongly with temperature, resulting in some degree of stacking disorder in ice grown from vapor in the tropical tropopause layer, and in polar stratospheric and noctilucent clouds. Our findings support and explain the evolution of the morphology of ice crystals from hexagonal to trigonal symmetry with decreasing temperature, as reported by experiments and in situ measurements in clouds. We conclude that selective growth of the elusive cubic ice polymorph by manipulation of the interfacial properties can likely be achieved at the ice−liquid interface but not at the ice−vapor interface.},

abstract = {Snow in the environment acts as a host to rich chemistry and provides a matrix for physical exchange of contaminants within the ecosystem. The goal of this review is to summarise the current state of knowledge of physical processes and chemical reactivity in surface snow with relevance to polar regions. It focuses on a description of impurities in distinct compartments present in surface snow, such as snow crystals, grain boundaries, crystal surfaces, and liquid parts. It emphasises the microscopic description of the ice surface and its link with the environment. Distinct differences between the disordered air-ice interface, often termed quasi-liquid layer, and a liquid phase are highlighted. The reactivity in these different compartments of surface snow is discussed using many experimental studies, simulations, and selected snow models from the molecular to the macro-scale. Although new experimental techniques have extended our knowledge of the surface properties of ice and their impact on some single reactions and processes, others occurring on, at or within snow grains remain unquantified. The presence of liquid or liquid-like compartments either due to the formation of brine or disorder at surfaces of snow crystals below the freezing point may strongly modify reaction rates. Therefore, future experiments should include a detailed characterisation of the surface properties of the ice matrices. A further point that remains largely unresolved is the distribution of impurities between the different domains of the condensed phase inside the snowpack, i.e. in the bulk solid, in liquid at the surface or trapped in confined pockets within or between grains, or at the surface. While surface-sensitive laboratory techniques may in the future help to resolve this point for equilibrium conditions, additional uncertainty for the environmental snowpack may be caused by the highly dynamic nature of the snowpack due to the fast metamorphism occurring under certain environmental conditions. Due to these gaps in knowledge the first snow chemistry models have attempted to reproduce certain processes like the long-term incorporation of volatile compounds in snow and firn or the release of reactive species from the snowpack. Although so far none of the models offers a coupled approach of physical and chemical processes or a detailed representation of the different compartments, they have successfully been used to reproduce some field experiments. A fully coupled snow chemistry and physics model remains to be developed.},

abstract = {The theoretical basis of the first-principles molecular dynamics introduced by Car and Parrinello [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 2471 (1985)] is investigated. We elucidate how the classical dynamics generated by the Car-Parrinello Lagrangian approximates efficiently the quantum adiabatic evolution of a system and discuss the role played by the spectrum of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian of Kohn and Sham [Phys. Rev. 140, A1133 (1965)]. A detailed characterization of the statistical ensemble sampled in the numerical simulation is given. By combining theoretical arguments and numerical results we demonstrate that the motion of the electronic variables is a superposition of a direct drag due to the ions and of high-frequency normal modes. By making a connection with the averaging methods of classical mechanics, we argue that whenever it is possible to get a large separation between the time scales of these modes and the ionic frequencies, the dynamics of the ions closely approximates that resulting from the adiabatic approximation. We introduce simple n-level models, easily amenable to analytic treatment, to add clarity and study the possible mechanisms of broken adiabaticity encountered in the actual calculations.},

abstract = {We report results of long timescale adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations aimed at identifying possible molecular reordering processes on both proton-disordered and ordered (Fletcher) basal plane (0001) surfaces of hexagonal ice. The simulations are based on a force field for flexible molecules and span a time interval of up to 50 $\mu$s at a temperature of 100 K, which represents a lower bound to the temperature range of earth{\&}apos;s atmosphere. Additional calculations using both density functional theory and an ab initio based polarizable potential function are performed to test and refine the force field predictions. Several distinct processes are found to occur readily even at this low temperature, including concerted reorientation (flipping) of neighboring surface molecules, which changes the pattern of dangling H-atoms, and the formation of interstitial defects by the downwards motion of upper-bilayer molecules. On the proton-disordered surface, one major surface roughening process is observed that significantly disrupts the crystalline structure. Despite much longer simulation time, such roughening processes are not observed on the highly ordered Fletcher surface which is energetically more stable because of smaller repulsive interaction between neighboring dangling H-atoms. However, a more localized process takes place on the Fletcher surface involving a surface molecule transiently leaving its lattice site. The flipping process provides a facile pathway of increasing proton-order and stabilizing the surface, supporting a predominantly Fletcher-like ordering of low-temperature ice surfaces. Our simulations also show that eventual proton-disordered patches on the surface may induce significant local reconstructions. Further, a subset of the molecules on the Fletcher surface are susceptible to forming interstitial defects which might provide active sites for various chemical reactions in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {New methods for integrating the Car–Parrinello equations with ultrasoft pseudopotentials are introduced. In particular, the difficulties associated with the generalized orthonormality constraint condition i (RI) j=ij are addressed. It is shown that the equations of motion can be integrated using the velocity Verlet/RATTLE scheme, and a new method, the constrained nonorthogonal orbital method, that eliminates the need to enforce this constraint explicitly is introduced. In this new scheme, the generalized orthonormality constraint is satisfied implicitly, thus allowing the freedom to choose simpler constraint conditions. We show that usual N3 scaling associated with the calculation of the Lagrange multipliers in the constraint force can be reduced to an N2 calculation by the use of a simple set of norm or length constraints on the electronic orbitals without sacrificing accuracy. The constrained nonorthogonal orbital method is shown to be considerably simpler to implement and more efficient than the standard approach to the ultrasoft pseudopotential problem. {\textcopyright}1995 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Hannah2015,
abstract = {We examine the role played by surface structure and passivation in thermal transport at semiconductor/organic interfaces. Such interfaces dominate thermal transport in semiconductor nanomaterials owing to material dimensions much smaller than the bulk phonon mean free path. Utilizing reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we calculate the interfacial thermal conductance (G) between a hexane solvent and chemically passivated wurtzite CdSe surfaces. In particular, we examine the dependence of G on the CdSe slab thickness, the particular exposed crystal facet, and the extent of surface passivation. Our results indicate a nonmonotonic dependence of G on ligand-grafting density, with interfaces generally exhibiting higher thermal conductance for increasing surface coverage up to ∼0.08 ligands/{\AA}(2) (75-100{\%} of a monolayer, depending on the particular exposed facet) and decreasing for still higher coverages. By analyzing orientational ordering and solvent penetration into the ligand layer, we show that a balance of competing effects is responsible for this nonmonotonic dependence. Although the various unpassivated CdSe surfaces exhibit similar G values, the crystal structure of an exposed facet nevertheless plays an important role in determining the interfacial thermal conductance of passivated surfaces, as the density of binding sites on a surface determines the ligand-grafting densities that may ultimately be achieved. We demonstrate that surface passivation can increase G relative to a bare surface by roughly 1 order of magnitude and that, for a given extent of passivation, thermal conductance can vary by up to a factor of ∼2 between different surfaces, suggesting that appropriately tailored nanostructures may direct heat flow in an anisotropic fashion for interface-limited thermal transport.},

Using a resistance temperature probe for in situ monitoring we demonstrate that the hotspot temperature was lowered by ∼28 °C for a chip operating at 1,300 W cm(-2). Thermal resistance probed by pulsed photothermal reflectance measurements demonstrated an improved thermal coupling due to functionalization on the graphene-graphene oxide interface. Three functionalization molecules manifest distinct interfacial thermal transport behaviour, corroborating our atomistic calculations in unveiling the role of molecular chain length and functional groups. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the functionalization constrains the cross-plane phonon scattering, which in turn enhances in-plane heat conduction of the bonded graphene film by recovering the long flexural phonon lifetime.},

abstract = {With the non-isotropic velocity scaling (NIVS) approach to reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD), it is possible to impose an unphysical thermal flux between different regions of inhomogeneous systems such as solid/liquid interfaces. We have applied NIVS to compute the interfacial thermal conductance at a metal/organic solvent interface that has been chemically capped by butanethiol molecules. Our calculations suggest that coupling between the metal and liquid phases is enhanced by the capping agents, leading to a greatly enhanced conductivity at the interface. Specifically, the chemical bond between the metal and the capping agent introduces a vibrational overlap that is not present without the capping agent, and the overlap between the vibrational spectra (metal to cap, cap to solvent) provides a mechanism for rapid thermal transport across the interface. Our calculations also suggest that this is a nonmonotonic function of the fractional coverage of the surface, as moderate coverages allow diffusive heat transport of solvent molecules that have been in close contact with the capping agent.},

In all cases, thermal conductance of the ligand-protected particles was higher than the bare metal-solvent interface. A number of mechanisms for the enhanced conductance were investigated, including thiolate-driven corrugation of the metal surface, solvent ordering at the interface, solvent-ligand interpenetration, and ligand ordering relative to the particle surface.

abstract = {Liquid water can persist in a supercooled state to below 238 K in the Earth's atmosphere, a temperature range where homogeneous nucleation becomes increasingly probable. However, the rate of homogeneous ice nucleation in supercooled water is poorly constrained, in part, because supercooled water eludes experimental scrutiny in the region of the homogeneous nucleation regime where it can exist only fleetingly. Here we present a new parameterization of the rate of homogeneous ice nucleation based on classical nucleation theory. In our approach, we constrain the key terms in classical theory, i.e., the diffusion activation energy and the ice-liquid interfacial energy, with physically consistent parameterizations of the pertinent quantities. The diffusion activation energy is related to the translational self-diffusion coefficient of water for which we assess a range of descriptions and conclude that the most physically consistent fit is provided by a power law. The other key term is the interfacial energy between the ice embryo and supercooled water whose temperature dependence we constrain using the Turnbull correlation, which relates the interfacial energy to the difference in enthalpy between the solid and liquid phases. The only adjustable parameter in our model is the absolute value of the interfacial energy at one reference temperature. That value is determined by fitting this classical model to a selection of laboratory homogeneous ice nucleation data sets between 233.6 K and 238.5 K. On extrapolation to temperatures below 233 K, into a range not accessible to standard techniques, we predict that the homogeneous nucleation rate peaks between about 227 and 231 K at a maximum nucleation rate many orders of magnitude lower than previous parameterizations suggest. This extrapolation to temperatures below 233 K is consistent with the most recent measurement of the ice nucleation rate in micrometer-sized droplets at temperatures of 227–232 K on very short time scales using an X-ray laser technique. In summary, we present a new physically constrained parameterization for homogeneous ice nucleation which is consistent with the latest literature nucleation data and our physical understanding of the properties of supercooled water.},

We observe the formation of a thin liquid layer at the ice surface at temperatures below the melting point for all models and the three planes considered. For a given plane it was found that the thickness of a liquid layer was similar for different water models, when the comparison is made at the same undercooling with respect to the melting point of the model. The liquid layer thickness is found to increase with temperature. For a fixed temperature it was found that the thickness of the liquid layer decreases in the following order: the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane, and the secondary prismatic plane. For the TIP4P/Ice model, a model reproducing the experimental value of the melting temperature of ice, the first clear indication of the formation of a liquid layer, appears at about -100 degrees C for the basal plane, at about -80 degrees C for the primary prismatic plane, and at about -70 degrees C for the secondary prismatic plane.},

I performed isobaric-isothermal simulations (1 bar) of 1185 water molecules using the GROMACS package. I quantified the structural properties using the oxygen-oxygen radial distribution functions, order parameters, and the hydrogen bond distribution functions, whereas, to analyze the dynamic properties I studied the behavior of the history-dependent bond correlation functions and the non-Gaussian parameter alpha2(t) of the mean square displacement of water molecules. When the temperature decreases, the translational (tau) and orientational (Q) order parameters are linearly correlated, and both increase indicating an increasing structural order in the systems. The probability of occurrence of four hydrogen bonds and Q both have a reciprocal dependence with T, though the analysis of the hydrogen bond distributions permits to describe the changes in the dynamics and structure of water more reliably. Thus, an increase on the caging effect and the occurrence of long-time hydrogen bonds occur below 293 K, in the range of temperatures in which predominates a four hydrogen bond structure in the system.},

abstract = {We present the results of molecular dynamics simulations in which ice I(h) slabs with free basal, prismatic, 28° pyramidal, and 14° pyramidal facets are exposed to vapor. All simulations were carried out at 250 K using a six-site intermolecular potential. Characteristics common to all facets include spontaneous development of a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) within ∼10 ns and QLL stratification into outer ($\epsilon$(1)) and inner ($\epsilon$(2)) sublayers having on average two and three hydrogen bonds, respectively. Vapor pressure, based on the rate of escape of molecules from the QLL to the vapor phase, is found to be greatest for the 14° pyramidal and basal facets (∼230 Pa), while significantly lower values are obtained for the prismatic and 28° pyramidal facets (∼200 Pa). The geometric thickness of the QLL also varies between facets, with the 14° pyramidal having the greatest thickness. The free prismatic and pyramidal facets exhibit significant anisotropic diffusivity, in-plane motion being faster in the trans-prismatic direction than in the basal-to-basal direction. The in-plane diffusion length is greatest for the 28° pyramidal facet and smallest for the prismatic facet. This diversity of facet-specific properties provides a rich set of possibilities for mechanisms of ice crystal growth and ablation.},

abstract = {It is widely recognized that dipolar interactions play a fundamental role in water. Less emphasis is put on the effects dues to the quadrupole moment. The recent calculation of the phase diagram for several rigid, nonpolarizable water models has shown that this is a rather severe test for water potentials. In this work, we analyze the results yielded by popular three-point-charge water models (TIP3P, SPC, SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P- Ew, TIP4P/2005, and TIP4P/Ice) and attempt to correlate them with the molecular dipoles and quadrupoles. It is shown that the melting temperatures of the proton disordered ices depend almost linearly on the quadrupole moments. However, the relative stability of ice II with respect to ices III, V, and VI seems to be rather dependent on the ratio of dipolar/quadrupolar forces. Small departures from a given ratio increase the stability of ice II and result in a serious deterioration of the phase diagram. Simple expressions are derived for the dipole and quadrupole moments, which allow us to analyze the effect of these multipole moments in the phase diagram when the rest of the molecular parameters are fixed. Satisfactory results for both the melting temperatures and for the relative stability of the different ices are obtained only when the molecular quadrupole approaches that of the isolated water molecule. Or, expressed in terms of the model parameters, acceptable results require that the negative charge be shifted from the oxygen toward the hydrogen positions by 0.14 {\AA} or more.},

abstract = {Aqueous nanoscale systems feature a distinct electrowetting behavior, sensitive to not only the strength but also the direction and polarity of the applied electric field. These effects have so far not been tested in solutions of ions, although electrolytes are commonly present in electro- wetting experiments. We describe atomistic simulations of sessile salty nanodrops on an apolar substrate under electric fields in a miniature mimic of the experimental setup of a drop inside a capacitor. In the absence of field, the contact angle riseswith salt concentration. The effect is weaker when the surface is more hydrophobic. The electric field lowers the contact angle, but the polarity dependence, observed in neat water and related to directional hydrogen bond effects, is diminished in the presence of screening ions. This is important for nanofluidics, as the addition of salt can improve electrowetting inside a nanopore where uneven wettabilities of opposing walls are found in pure water. The different hydration properties of cation and anion are reflected in their density profiles. The droplet curvature enhances ion withdrawal from the liquid/vapor interface, the depletion being more pronounced for cations (Na+,Mg2+) than anions (Cl). The dependence of the contact angle on the field strength varies nonmonotonically with salt concentration, suggesting that moderate concentrations represent the optimal regime for the electric control of wetting properties at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {The MB-pol many-body potential has recently emerged as an accurate molecular model for water simulations from the gas to the condensed phase. In this study, the accuracy of MB-pol is systematically assessed across the three phases of water through extensive comparisons with experimental data and high-level ab initio calculations. Individual many-body contributions to the interaction energies as well as vibrational spectra of water clusters calculated with MB-pol are in excellent agreement with reference data obtained at the coupled cluster level. Several structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure are investigated through classical molecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature. The structural properties of the liquid phase are in nearly quantitative agreement with X-ray diffraction data available over the temperature range from 268 to 368 K. The analysis of other thermodynamic and dynamical quantities emphasizes the importance of explicitly including nuclear quantum e?ects in the simulations, especially at low temperature, for a physically correct description of the properties of liquid water. Furthermore, both densities and lattice energies of several ice phases are also correctly reproduced by MB-pol. Following a recent study of DFT models for water, a score is assigned to each computed property, which demonstrates the high and, in many respects, unprecedented accuracy of MB-pol in representing all three phases of water.},

For method (i) we find an approximately Arrhenius temperature dependence of the bond lifetime, and find that the distribution of bond lifetimes is extremely sensitive to the choice of bond definition. For method (ii) we find-independent of bond definition-that the dynamics are consistent with the predictions of the mode-coupling theory, suggesting that the slow dynamics of hydrogen bonds can be explained in the same framework as standard transport quantities. Our results allow us to clarify the significance of the choice of both bond definition and analysis technique.},

abstract = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory(DFT) has become established as an indispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including those important in chemistry, surface science, biology, and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures, and liquidwater, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments.},

abstract = {An intermolecular potential model of H 2 O with six interaction sites is proposed. The model is developed for the simulation of ice and water near the melting point. Parameters in the potential are determined to reproduce the real melting point of ice, and densities of ice and water near the melting point, which are predicted by calculating derivatives of the free energies and volumes of ice and water against potential parameters. Free energy calculations are carried out for several ice structures and water, and the results are compared with those obtained in four- and five-site models, which are currently in use. It is shown that, only in the present six-site model, the proton-disordered hexagonal ice is the stable structure at the melting point, as in real ice. The melting point of the proton-disordered hexagonal ice at 1 atm is estimated to be 271±9 K in the present model, which is in good agreement with the real melting point of 273.15 K. Moreover, results of Monte Carlo simulations of ice and water show that the present six-site model reproduces well the real structural and thermodynamic properties of ice and water near the melting point.},

abstract = {A re-parameterization of the standard TIP4P water model for use with Ewald techniques is introduced, providing an overall global improvement in water properties relative to several popular nonpolarizable and polarizable water potentials. Using high precision simulations, and careful application of standard analytical corrections, we show that the new TIP4P-Ew potential has a density maximum at approximately 1 degrees C, and reproduces experimental bulk-densities and the enthalpy of vaporization, DeltaH(vap), from -37.5 to 127 degrees C at 1 atm with an absolute average error of less than 1{\%}. Structural properties are in very good agreement with x-ray scattering intensities at temperatures between 0 and 77 degrees C and dynamical properties such as self-diffusion coefficient are in excellent agreement with experiment. The parameterization approach used can be easily generalized to rehabilitate any water force field using available experimental data over a range of thermodynamic points.},

abstract = {A close analytical estimate for the combinatorial entropy of partially ordered ice phases is presented. The expression obtained is very general, as it can be used for any ice phase obeying the Bernal-Fowler rules. The only input required is a number of crystallographic parameters, and the experimentally observed proton site occupancies. For fully disordered phases such as hexagonal ice, it recovers the result deduced by Pauling, while for fully ordered ice it is found to vanish. Although the space groups determined for ice I, VI, and VII require random proton site occupancies, it is found that such random allocation of protons does not necessarily imply random orientational disorder. The theoretical estimate for the combinatorial entropy is employed together with free energy calculations in order to obtain the phase diagram of ice from 0 to 10 GPa. Overall qualitative agreement with experiment is found for the TIP4P model of water. An accurate estimate of the combinatorial entropy is found to play an important role in determining the stability of partially ordered ice phases, such as ice III and ice V.},

With small modifications, a new TIP5P-like potential can be made which is very accurate for liquid water when used with Ewald sums, a more physical and increasingly more commonly used method for treating long-ranged electrostatic interactions. The new model demonstrates a density maximum near 4 degrees C, like the TIP5P model, and otherwise is similar to the TIP5P model for thermodynamic, dielectric, and dynamical properties of liquid water over a range of temperatures and densities. An analysis of this and other commonly used water models reveals how the quadrupole moment of a model can influence the dielectric response of liquid water.},

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

Since the melting temperature of ice I(h) for the TIP4P model is now known [E. Sanz, C. Vega, J. L. F. Abascal, and L. G. MacDowell, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 255701 (2004)], it is possible to use the Gibbs-Duhem methodology [D. Kofke, J. Chem.

We have found that the melting temperatures of ice I(h) for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P models are T = 190 K, 215 K, 146 K, 232 K, 245 K, and 274 K, respectively. The relative stability of ice I(h) with respect to ice II for these models has also been considered. It turns out that for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, and TIP5P the stable phase at the normal melting point is ice II (so that ice I(h) is not a thermodynamically stable phase for these models). For TIP4P and TIP4P/Ew, ice I(h) is the stable solid phase at the standard melting point. The location of the negative charge along the H-O-H bisector appears as a critical factor in the determination of the relative stability between the I(h) and II ice forms. The methodology proposed in this paper can be used to investigate the effect upon a coexistence line due to a change in the potential parameters.},

These models are TIP4P/Ew, TIP4P/2005, and TIP4P/ice and can be considered as modified versions of the TIP4P model. By design TIP4P reproduces the vaporization enthalpy of water at room temp., whereas TIP4P/Ew and TIP4P/2005 match the temp. of max. d. and TIP4P/ice the melting temp. of water. Recently, the m.p. for each of these models has been computed, making it possible for the first time to compute the complete vapor-liq. equil. curve from the triple point to the crit. point. From the coexistence results at high temp., it is possible to est. the crit. properties of these models. None of them is capable of reproducing accurately the crit. pressure or the vapor pressures and densities. Addnl., in the cases of TIP4P and TIP4P/ice the crit. temps. are too low and too high, resp., compared to the exptl. value. However, models accounting for the d. max. of water, such as TIP4P/Ew and TIP4P/2005 provide a better est. of the crit. temp. In particular, TIP4P/2005 provides a crit. temp. just 7 K below the exptl. result as well as an extraordinarily good description of the liq. densities from the triple point to the crit. point. All TIP4P-like models present a ratio of the triple point temp. to the crit. point temp. of about 0.39, compared with the exptl. value of 0.42. As is the case for any effective potential neglecting many body forces, TIP4P/2005 fails in describing simultaneously the vapor and the liq. phases of water. However, it can be considered as one of the best effective potentials of water for describing condensed phases, both liq. and solid.

abstract = {A new fixed-point charge potential model for water has been developed, targeting the accurate prediction of the vapor-liquid coexistence properties over a broad temperature range. The model consists of a Buckingham exponential-6 group at the oxygen center and a set of three point charges. The new model was designed primarily to reproduce coexisting vapor and liquid densities, vapor pressures, and critical parameters and secondarily the liquid structure of water at ambient conditions. To obtain an optimum set of intermolecular potential parameters, the Gibbs ensemble and histogram reweighting grand canonical Monte Carlo methods were used to test a large number of models that covered a wide range of parameter space. Recently developed Hamiltonian scaling grand canonical Monte Carlo techniques enabled us to move through parameter space in an efficient manner. Properties of the new model were determined over the temperature range of the liquid. Results were compared to the SPC, SPC/E, and MSPC/E models and to experimental data. The new model was found to be better than existing models for the coexistence densities, vapor pressures, critical parameters, and the second virial coefficient. It is inferior to the SPC/E and MSPC/E models in reproducing the dielectric constant. The oxygen-hydrogen and hydrogen-hydrogen radial distributions are in good agreement with experimental data; however, the second shell of the oxygen-oxygen radial distribution of the new model does not have the correct form.

abstract = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory(DFT) has become established as an indispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including those important in chemistry, surface science, biology, and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures, and liquidwater, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments.},

abstract = {The ability of simple potential functions to describe the properties of liquid water at a range of thermodynamic state points has been explored. These simple potential function models represent a water molecule by a set of sites, either rigid or flexible relative to each other, that interact with a simple, generally classical, Hamiltonian, which has parameters that are empirically determined. Calculations on several models that include intramolecular flexibility, electronic polarization or quantum mechanical effects have been performed. The consequences of altering these parameters have been systematically examined to determine factors of importance in reproducing properties of pure liquid water. It is found that simple four-site models that incorporate classical intramolecular flexibility or electronic polarization do not improve the description of the density anomaly of liquid water. Quantum statistical mechanical path integral calculations on the classical rigid nonpolarizable TIP5P model [J. Chem. Phys. 112, 8910 (2000)] and the classical flexible nonpolarizable TIP4F model indicate that although quantum mechanical effects destructure the rigid model, they improve the radial distribution and energy distribution properties of the flexible model. In addition, although quantum effects make the density behavior of the rigid model worse, they improve the density behavior of the flexible model. Path integral calculations have also been performed on quantum D2O TIP5P water; this leads to a temperature of maximum density that is higher and to a more structured liquid than results from calculations on quantum H2O TIP5P water. A similar effect is seen with calculations on a five-site rigid model, TIP5P(PIMC), which was parameterized using path integral rather than classical Monte Carlo calculations.

The reproduction of this maximum is a stringent test for potential models used commonly in simulations of water. The relation between the melting temperature and the temperature of maximum density for these potential models is unknown mainly due to our ignorance about the melting temperature of these models. Recently we have determined the melting temperature of ice I(h) for several commonly used models of water (SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P). In this work we locate the temperature of maximum density for these models. In this way the relative location of the temperature of maximum density with respect to the melting temperature is established. For SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP4P/Ew the maximum in density occurs at about 21-37 K above the melting temperature. In all these models the negative charge is located either on the oxygen itself or on a point along the H-O-H bisector. For the TIP5P and TIP5P-E models the maximum in density occurs at about 11 K above the melting temperature. The location of the negative charge appears as a geometrical crucial factor to the relative position of the temperature of maximum density with respect to the melting temperature.},

abstract = {We introduce the space-dependent correlation function C (Q)(r) and time-dependent autocorrelation function C (Q)(t) of the local tetrahedral order parameter Q identical with Q(r,t). By using computer simulations of 512 waterlike particles interacting through the transferable interaction potential with five points (TIP5 potential), we investigate C (Q)(r) in a broad region of the phase diagram. We find that at low temperatures C (Q)(t) exhibits a two-step time-dependent decay similar to the self-intermediate scattering function and that the corresponding correlation time tau(Q) displays a dynamic cross-over from non-Arrhenius behavior for T {\textgreater} T (W) to Arrhenius behavior for T {\textless} T (W), where T (W) denotes the Widom temperature where the correlation length has a maximum as T is decreased along a constant-pressure path. We define a tetrahedral entropy S (Q) associated with the local tetrahedral order of water molecules and find that it produces a major contribution to the specific heat maximum at the Widom line. Finally, we show that tau(Q) can be extracted from S (Q) by using an analog of the Adam-Gibbs relation.},

abstract = {In this work we present the result of an algorithm implementation for reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation which allows the prediction of viscosity. A non physical momentum flux is imposed by dividing the simulation box into slabs and applying an exchange of the largest negative and positive velocities atoms between the first and central slabs respectively, as result a velocity gradient is produced. This technique has been successfully implemented for atomistic simulations using a molecular dynamics package YASP which works on analytical potential. However, our work focuses on the implementation of RNEMD method into a molecular dynamics code GMQ which works on numerical potential. The developed code provides a reliable tool to predict viscosities for coarse-grained models via RNEMD technique. The results for Lennard–Jones liquids are presented as well as their comparison for both molecular dynamics codes. Our results are also in good agreement with experimental data.

abstract = {Understanding and predicting the behavior of water, especially in contact with various surfaces, is a scientific challenge. Molecular-level understanding of hydrophobic effects and their macroscopic consequences, in particular, is critical to many applications. Macroscopically, a surface is classified as hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on the contact angle formed by a water droplet. Because hydrophobic surfaces tend to cause water slip whereas hydrophilic ones do not, the former surfaces can yield self-cleaning garments and ice-repellent materials whereas the latter cannot. The results presented herein suggest that this dichotomy might be purely coincidental. Our simulation results demonstrate that hydrophilic surfaces can show features typically associated with hydrophobicity, namely liquid water slip. Further analysis provides details on the molecular mechanism responsible for this surprising result.},

abstract = {The dynamics and structure of water at hydrophobic and hydrophilic diamond surfaces is examined via non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations. For hydrophobic surfaces under shearing conditions, the general hydrodynamic boundary condition involves a finite surface slip. The value of the slip length depends sensitively on the surface water interaction strength and the surface roughness; heuristic scaling relations between slip length, contact angle, and depletion layer thickness are proposed. Inert gas in the aqueous phase exhibits pronounced surface activity but only mildly increases the slip length. On polar hydrophilic surfaces, in contrast, slip is absent, but the water viscosity is found to be increased within a thin surface layer. The viscosity and the thickness of this surface layer depend on the density of polar surface groups. The dynamics of single water molecules in the surface layer exhibits a similar distinction: on hydrophobic surfaces the dynamics is purely diffusive, while close to a hydrophilic surface transient binding or trapping of water molecules over times of the order of hundreds of picoseconds occurs. We also discuss in detail the effect of the Lennard-Jones cutoff length on the interfacial properties.},

Yet the atomic-level structure of even the pristine ice surface at low temperature is still far from well understood. This computational study focuses on the pattern of dangling H and dangling O (lone pairs) atoms at the basal ice surface. Dangling atoms serve as binding sites for adsorbates capable of hydrogen- and electrostatic bonding. Extension of the well known orientational disorder ("proton disorder") of bulk crystal ice to the surface would naturally suggest a disordered dangling atom pattern; however, extensive computer simulations employing two different empirical potentials indicate significant free energy preference for a striped phase with alternating rows of dangling H and dangling O atoms, as suggested long ago by Fletcher [Fletcher NH (1992) Philos Mag 66:109-115]. The presence of striped phase domains within the basal surface is consistent with the hitherto unexplained minor fractional peaks in the helium diffraction pattern observed 10 years ago. Compared with the disordered model, the striped model yields improved agreement between computations and experimental ppp-polarized sum frequency generation spectra.},

At 277 K, the different energy levels are about evenly populated, but at a lower temperature, a transition to an ordered form is expected. This form was found to agree with the ice phase XI. The difference in lattice energies among the polymorphs was rationalized in terms of structural characteristics.

This method extends earlier reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) methods which use momentum exchange swapping moves. The standard swapping moves can create nonthermal velocity distributions and are difficult to use for interfacial calculations. By using nonisotropic velocity scaling (NIVS) on the molecules in specific regions of a system, it is possible to impose momentum or thermal flux between regions of a simulation while conserving the linear momentum and total energy of the system. To test the method, we have computed the thermal conductivity of model liquid and solid systems as well as the interfacial thermal conductivity of a metal-water interface. We find that the NIVS-RNEMD improves the problematic velocity distributions that develop in other RNEMD methods.},

One promising avenue of research has been to adapt the rate- and state- dependent models which are prevalent in rock friction. In such models it is assumed that there is some fixed critical slip displacement, which is effectively a measure of the displacement over which memory effects might be considered important. Here we show experimentally that a fixed critical slip displacement is not a valid assumption in ice friction, whereas a constant critical slip time appears to hold across a range of parameters and scales. As a simple rule of thumb, memory effects persist to a significant level for 10. s. We then discuss the implications of this finding for modelling sea ice friction and for our understanding of friction in general. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results from field tests on the friction of sea ice on sea ice performed in the Barents Sea and fjords at Spitsbergen. The effects of the sliding velocity (6. mm/s to 105. mm/s), air temperatures (-. 2. °C to -. 20. °C), normal load (300. N to 2000. N), presence of sea water in the interface, and ice grain orientation with respect to the sliding direction on the friction coefficient were investigated. The effect of the hold time on the static friction coefficient was also studied. The roughness of the ice surface is an important parameter that determines the value of the friction coefficient. Repeated sliding over the same track led to surface polishing and decreased the kinetic friction coefficient from 0.48 to 0.05. The studies showed that the friction coefficient is independent of the velocity when sliding occurs between natural ice surfaces. As the contacting surfaces became smoother, the kinetic friction coefficient started to depend on the velocity, as predicted by existing ice friction models. Both very high ({\~{}}. 0.5) and low ({\~{}}. 0.05) kinetic friction coefficients were obtained in the tests performed at high (-. 2. °C) and low (-. 20. °C) air temperatures. The presence of sea water in the sliding interface had very little effect on the static and kinetic friction coefficients. The static friction coefficient logarithmically increased with the hold time from {\~{}}. 0.6 at 5. s to 1.26 at 960. s. The results are discussed, and the dependences are compared with existing friction models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sliding friction is known to be the largest energy sink during ridging events and it controls the force during rafting. During the 1994 Sea Ice Mechanics Initiative (SIMI), we conducted a set of sliding friction tests by pulling meter-size blocks of sea ice over the natural ice cover to determine the friction coefficients. The ice blocks were similar in size to those occurring in natural rafting and ridging events. Our simple tests were conducted by pulling the blocks using a boat trailer winch and cable. This system was definitely compliant, and elasticity of the cable was an important property that gave rise to stick-slip behavior comparable to that observed during rafting and ridging events.A simple model was introduced to analyze the data. It proved useful in understanding the stick-slip response, and exposed the proper way to interpret results. Static and dynamic friction coefficients are presented for 25 test cases for blocks of various sizes pulled over ice covered with no snow and a small amount of snow. The model shows how to interpret the friction coefficients in this compliant system correctly. Interestingly, static and dynamic friction coefficients do not occur at the times of maximum and minimum pulling forces, respectively. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The gliding of polyethylen on snow was examined in laboratory experiments and in field tests under racing conditions. Special emphasis was given to the investigation of the influence of snow temperature and load on the gliding. In laboratory tests, the coefficient of friction (c.o.f.) was measured using a tribometer that was placed in a freezing chamber. The temperature was varied from -25??C to 0??C, and the load was varied from 50 to 300 kPa. The coefficient of friction is strongly dependent on the snow temperature. It is lowest at around -3??C and increases for low snow temperatures (T {\textless} -5??C) as well as for a snow temperature close to 0??C. The influence of the pressure decreases with increasing snow temperature, and above -6??C, there is no difference detectable between different loads. These results are confirmed by gliding tests conducted in the field. At around -3??C, the skis are fastest. The gliding properties are worse for a snow temperature close to 0??C and in the cold temperature range from -20??C to -5??C. Heavier skiers are faster only in this low temperature range; above -6??C, no difference of the gliding properties due to the weight of the skier can be found. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We present theoretical calculations of the adsorption, diffusion and island formation of water admolecules on the basal plane surface of an ice Ih crystal. These are preliminary calculations based on the simple TIP4P interaction potential, a pairwise additive potential function based on point charges. At low coverage, we find that an admolecule prefers to sit at non-crystallographic sites on the surface (i.e., sites that do not fit into the ice lattice). Since ice Ih is proton disordered, no two sites are exactly the same and there is a wide range of binding energies. For some local environments the binding energy is of the order of, or even larger than, the cohesive energy. The proton disorder also results in a range of activation energies for diffusion. After mapping out a large number of diffusion barriers using the nudged elastic band method, a kinetic Monte-Carlo calculation of the diffusion at 140 K was performed. At early time, the mean squared displacement has anomalous scaling with time as is common for diffusion on random lattices. But, at longer time the scaling is normal and a diffusion coefficient can be obtained. The diffusivity is slightly larger than a recent experimental upper bound given by Brown and George. The energetics and dynamics of the formation of small islands on the ice surface have also been studied. It is found that islands up to and including pentamer are non-crystallographic, but the hexamer is crystallographic. While the formation of a crystallographic hexamer from a non-crystallographic pentamer and a new admolecule involves a complex concerted motion of all the island molecules and a large relaxation of the substrate, the activation energy for the process is estimated to be quite small, smaller than the admolecule diffusion barrier. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to examine the properties of the transition layer (quasi-liquid layer, QLL) on the surface of an ice crystal at temperatures just below its bulk melting point (0°C) using ellipsometry. The refractive index n1 and thickness d of the transition layer were measured on both basal {\{}0001{\}} and prismatic 1011¯ faces of ice crystals. The ice surface sample used was a slice section of a negative crystal, which is a hole growing to the shape of a sharp hexagonal prism in an ice single crystal. The surface prepared in this way was molecularly smooth and free from contaminations. Transition layers were detected on the {\{}0001{\}} and 1011¯ faces at the condition of equilibrium vapor pressure. The measured n1 was 1.330 for both faces, which is quite close to the refractive index of bulk water at 0°C (nw = 1.3327) rather than that of ice (n1 = 1.3079). Consequently, the transition layer should be water-like (namely, QLL), and this result gives direct evidence of surface melting. The critical temperatures (Tw) at which the QLL was detected on the surface were −2°C for the {\{}0001{\}} face and −2 to −4°C for the 1011¯ face. The thickness of the layer steeply increases as the temperature approached the melting point. However, the temperature dependences of the layer thickness showed a systematic difference between the {\{}0001{\}} and 1011¯ faces. That is, Tw(0001){\textgreater}Tw1011¯ and d(0001){\textless}d1011¯ for a given temperature above −4°C. These characteristics were qualitatively explained by theoretical arguments on the basis of the thermodynamics of the surface. Finally, it was indicated that the structure of the interface between the QLL and the ice crystal on the 1011¯ face changes from smooth to rough at a temperature of −2°C, and that the roughening transition temperature (Tr) at which the facets disappear from the growing negative crystals or snow crystals is higher than Tw.},

abstract = {The relationship between the degree of ionization and the environment of a strong acid is of basic scientific interest. Often this relationship reduces to the interdependence of ion/acid hydration and proton transfer. Despite the presence of pure water, the surface of crystalline ice, particularly at cryogenic temperatures, is one of limited (controlled?) availability of water of hydration. Here, the detailed nature of the ice surface and the states of strong acids adsorbed to ice at cryogenic temperatures are examined. These subjects are of special current interest since the ability to model the complex chemistry that occurs on the surfaces of water-rich particles in the atmosphere, particularly in the stratosphere over the polar regions, requires a valid concept of the acid-ice interface. Our combined spectroscopic and simulation studies have identified the surface of free-standing ice particles as badly disordered, with a range of water-ring sizes and an increased level of H-bond saturation relative to an ordered ice surface. FT-IR results are reported for the interaction of the surface of such ice particles with submonolayer amounts of adsorbed DCI, DBr, and HNO 3 and for multilayer exposure to DCI. The DCI and DBr adsorbed states demonstrate behavior familiar from observations on strongly bound molecular adsorbates. Two methods have been devised for exposure of the nanocrystals to HNO 1. One gives an ionic state initially, while the initial state of the other approach is molecular. In both instances, the system is observed to evolve, with time/warming, towards a common mixed molecular-ionic adsorbed state.},

abstract = {A laboratory experiment is described during which the uptake of HNO3 and HCl vapor by dendritic snow crystals and by single crystalline and polycrystalline small ice spheres was studied at ppbv and ppmv gas levels and at temperatures between 0 and -40??C. In one experimental investigation the vapor was allowed to be adsorbed onto the surface of the ice particles. During another experimental investigation the ice particles were allowed to grow from water vapor on fine fibers in the presence of the HNO3 and HCl vapor. The results of our experiments show that under both conditions significant amounts of HNO3 and HCl became scavenged by the ice particles. Scavenging by adsorption was maximum for both vapors at temperatures near 0??C where a quasi-liquid layer exists on the surface of ice. With decreasing temperature the uptake of HNO3 and HCl vapor decreased and kept on decreasing for HCl with further decrease in temperature. In contrast, the uptake of HNO3 reached a minimum near -18??C to increase again strongly with further decrease in temperature. The temperature-dependent,uptake of both vapors were explained on the basis of surface melting caused by the vapors. For the case that the ice crystals were growing in an atmosphere supersaturated with respect to ice while simultaneously being exposed to HNO3 or HCl vapor we noted that gas scavenging was less than during simple adsorption by a nongrowing crystal. Our experiments further showed that HNO3 once taken up by an ice particle would not desorb if the ice particle remained at ice saturation. Our experiments also indicated that some of the adsorbed HNO3 and HCl diffuses into the ice particle. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {A precise and accurate measurement of the crystal structure of ice-Ih is hindered by its disordered H-bond network. In this work, we carried out first-principle calculations to study the effects of H-bondtopology on the structure of ice-Ih with emphasis on the molecular geometry of water and the distortion in oxygen lattice. An analytic algorithm based on group and graph theory is employed to enumerate all possible configurations in a given unit cell and to select a set of structures for detailed examinations. In total we have studied more than 60 ice-Ih structures in a hexagonal unit cell of 48 water molecules by quantum-chemical methods and found a significant amount of static distortion in the oxygen positions from their crystallographic positions which is in good agreements with highly significant higher-order terms obtained from both x-ray and neutron-diffraction data. Much debated structural information such as H–O–H angle and O–H bond length is found to be 106.34 ± 0.36 ° and 0.9997 ± 0.0008 {\AA} , compared to experimental value of 106.6 ± 1.5 ° and 0.986 ± 0.005 {\AA} . Detailed benchmarking calculations were carried out to gauge the influence of using different exchange and correlation functionals, pseudopotentials, and unit-cell sizes. Our results have proven that first-principle methods are useful complementary tools to experiments, especially for cases in which experimental accuracy is limited by intrinsic orientational disorder.},

The preparation of mirror-like single crystal ice surfaces and a special in situ X-ray chamber is described in detail. The X-ray scattering experiments using synchrotron radiation give clear evidence that all the investigated high-symmetry surfaces exhibit surface melting with onset temperatures Ts ??? - 13.5??C for the basal and Ts ??? - 12.5??C for the nonbasal surfaces. The temperature dependence of the thickness of the quasiliquid is presented and discussed in view of various theoretical predictions. In addition we found thermal faceting at nonbasal surfaces as well as a diffuse ("rough") solid-quasiliquid interface. The thermal properties of the observed surface disorder implies that the correlation length within the socalled "surface melt" is much larger than the correlation length in the bulk liquid indicating the presence of significant "substrate" interactions. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Coulomb energies of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric ordering of protons in ice Ih and Ic are compared for unit cells containing eight water molecules. The lowest energy is obtained for antiferroelectric ordering in both the hexagonal and cubic structures, with the hexagonal energy per molecule being lower by about 2×10−4q2/R, where q is the net change on the hydrogens and R is the oxygen–oxygen nearest-neighbour distance. The hexagonal ice energy is thus lower by about 0.3 meV per molecule, in the comparison of the lowest states. However, many of the possible configurations in the hexagonal eight-molecule cell have energies higher than the lowest energy of cubic ice. For both hexagonal and cubic structures, energy favours antiferroelectric hydrogen ordering, while entropy favours the weakly ferroelectric arrangements. An appendix considers Coulomb energies in cubic and hexagonal diamond, and shows that the electrostatic energy is lower in the naturally occurring cubic form.},

abstract = {A new interpretation of the habits of ice growing from vapour is proposed. The basic habits of ice alternate three times: plates (A) → -4°C → columns (B) → -10°C → plates (C) → between -20°C and -35°C → columns (D). The theory is based on a view- that the surface of ice just below 0°C is covered with a quasi-liquid layer, whose thickness $\theta${\{}symbol{\}} or coverage $\delta$ decreases with falling temperature, and therefore the growth mechanism of a crystal face changes also as follows: (I) Vapour-Quasi-Liquid- Solid mechanism ($\delta$ {\textgreater} 1), (II) Adhesive Growth on a surface strongly adsorbed by H2O molecules (0.02 {\textless} $\delta$ {\textless} 1) and (III) Two- Dimensional Nucleation Growth on a surface with low eigen adsorption ($\delta$ {\textless} 0.02). The type of surface structure and consequently the growth mechanism depends on the surface orientation and the temperature. The complicated habit change is caused mainly by the combination of surface kinetics of the {\{}0001{\}} and {\{}101{\&}{\#}x0304;10{\}} face. The first and second conversion temperature (TAB, TBC) are expected to be independent of the absolute supersaturation $\delta$P as found in experiments. On the other hand, the third (TCD) is the temperature where the usual two-dimensional nucleation growth rate of the {\{}0001{\}} face reaches the one of the {\{}1010{\}} face, and exceeds it by the effect of diffusion field, so that the third conversion temperature falls with decreasing $\delta$P. The marked columnar crystals observed at -7°C can be explained only by taking into account the spherical volume diffusion field near the {\{}0001{\}} face and a cylindrical one near the {\{}101{\&}{\#}x0304;10{\}} face. For plate-like crystals between -10°C and -20°C to -35°C the surface diffusion from {\{}0001{\}} to {\{}1010{\}} and volume diffision with cylindrical symmetry near {\{}101{\&}{\#}x0304;10{\}} faces is very important. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

Simulations are also presented for two proton ordered structures of ice Ih, the ferroelectric Cmc2(1) structure or ice XI and the antiferroelectric Pna2(1) structure. These simulations indicate that a transition to a proton ordered phase occurs at low temperatures (below 80 K). The symmetry of the ordered phase is found to be dependent on the water potential. The stability of the two proton ordered structures is due to a balance of short-ranged interactions which tend to stabilize the Pna2(1) structure and longer-range interactions which stabilize the Cmc2(1) structure.},

abstract = {A number of structurally diverse classes of "antifreeze" proteins that allow fish to survive in sub-zero ice-laden waters have been isolated from the blood plasma of cold water teleosts. However, despite receiving a great deal of attention, the one or more mechanisms through which these proteins act are not fully understood. In this report we have synthesized a type I antifreeze polypeptide (AFP) from the shorthorn sculpin Myoxocephalus scorpius using recombinant methods. Construction of a synthetic gene with optimized codon usage and expression as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein followed by purification yielded milligram amounts of polypeptide with two extra residues appended to the N terminus. Circular dichroism and NMR experiments, including residual dipolar coupling measurements on a N-15-labeled recombinant polypeptide, show that the polypeptides are a-helical with the first four residues being more flexible than the remainder of the sequence. Both the recombinant and synthetic polypeptides modify ice growth, forming facetted crystals just below the freezing point, but display negligible thermal hysteresis. Acetylation of Lys-10, Lys-20, and Lys-21 as well as the N terminus of the recombinant polypeptide gave a derivative that displays both thermal hysteresis (0.4 degreesC at 15 mg/ml) and ice crystal faceting. These results confirm that the N terminus of wild-type polypeptide is functionally important and support our previously proposed mechanism for all type I proteins, in which the hydrophobic face is oriented toward the ice at the ice/water interface.},

abstract = {The atomic force microscope was used to investigate surface properties of ice in a temperature range of −24 to −0.7 °C. An upper limit of the thickness of the liquidlike layer on the surface of ice was found to vary between about 12 nm at −24 °C and 70 nm at −0.7 °C. This was correlated with an increase of the adhesion force. In force-versus-distance measurements the tip penetrated the ice. This behavior can be interpreted in two ways: Either a “soft ice layer” exists between the liquidlike layer and bulk ice or the presence of the solid tip causes the ice surface to change its mechanical properties. Such an interfacial premelting might be relevant for friction. It might add to frictional heating as a cause for the lubricating liquid layer which reduces friction. In addition, friction was measured around −23 °C. With the atomic force microscope friction at individual microcontacts with a contact area of a few (10 nm)2 can be determined. Friction increases with decreasing sliding velocity, which is probably due to the penetration of the tip into the ice at low velocities.},

In contrast to the bulk we observe, at temperatures well below the onset for surface melting (Ts= -12.8??C), broad Lorentzian lines disclosing that the near-surface hydrogen bonding network has lost its long-range coherence prior to surface melting. A quantitative analysis of the results shows that a Bjerrum domain structure with a typical domain size of ???? = 20-30 A is present in a mesoscopic surface layer of a thickness greater than 250 ??. Within this surface layer the Bjerrum defect density is ???n?????=(5.7 ?? 2.5) ?? 1025m-3. These findings are discussed in view of theoretical models of the surface structure of ice which are based on the dipolar nature of the H2O molecule, and we find from this evidence that the Bjerrum domain structure is compatible with a diffuse screening layer which follows a charged surface. From straightforward screening arguments and the observed Bjerrum defect density, we can then estimate the surface charge density, and we find a remarkable agreement with recent friction experiments.},

A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties.

abstract = {A discrete element model is used to study shear rupture of sea ice under convergent wind stresses. The model includes compressive, tensile, and shear rupture of viscous elastic joints connecting floes that move under the action of the wind stresses. The adopted shear rupture is governed by Coulomb's criterion. The ice pack is a 400 km long square domain consisting of 4 km size floes. In the standard case with tensile strength 10 times smaller than the compressive strength, under uniaxial compression the failure regime is mainly shear rupture with the most probable scenario corresponding to that with the minimum failure work. The orientation of cracks delineating formed aggregates is bimodal with the peaks around the angles given by the wing crack theory determining diamond-shaped blocks. The ice block (floe aggregate) size decreases as the wind stress gradient increases since the elastic strain energy grows faster leading to a higher speed of crack propagation. As the tensile strength grows, shear rupture becomes harder to attain and compressive failure becomes equally important leading to elongation of blocks perpendicular to the compression direction and the blocks grow larger. In the standard case, as the wind stress confinement ratio increases the failure mode changes at a confinement ratio within 0.2-0.4, which corresponds to the analytical critical confinement ratio of 0.32. Below this value, the cracks are bimodal delineating diamond shape aggregates, while above this value failure becomes isotropic and is determined by small-scale stress anomalies due to irregularities in floe shape.},

Leads are critically important for climate modeling since they are a source for new ice and an avenue for heat exchange between the atmosphere and ocean. Therefore a specific representation for leads in a constitutive model for pack ice is considered essential. Presented here is an elastic-decohesive constitutive model whose purpose is to specifically indicate when a lead is initiated, to provide the orientation of the lead, to give the mode of failure, and to allow for the numerical determination of the width of leads. Both laboratory and in situ data of sea ice provide the motivation for the basic structure of the model. Sample paths in stress and strain space are used to illustrate how the model can simulate failure. The model can predict multiple failure planes, a feature that is necessary to simulate crack branching. Preexisting planes of weakness such as those formed from previous leads can also be accommodated.},

abstract = {[ 1] The ice pack covering northern seas is composed of a mixture of thick ridged and rafted ice, undeformed ice, and open water. Ice motions determined from satellite remote sensing data show that deformation of the pack takes place along the boundary of large floes. Eulerian continuum sea ice models can simulate this behavior to a degree by capturing the localization of gridded ice strength in some average sense. However, using a discontinuous Lagrangian approach that explicitly models ice floes and the interactions between them, it is possible to simulate both the fracture process that creates floe boundaries and the continued deformation along those floe boundaries. We have developed a granular model of the central Arctic ice pack that consists of thousands of individual grains that can freeze together, fracture apart, and interact through ridging. Accelerations produced by passing weather patterns and sustained quasi-steady deformation cause the model pack to fracture apart into floes composed of one or more grains. When the ice pack is nonuniformly accelerating due to passage of a weather pattern, simulations show that the factors that influence the size of the floes are the tensile strength of the joints between grains, the gradient of the wind field, and the average size of the individual grains. During sustained deformation the pack continues to deform along existing floe boundaries while stresses build and further fracture takes place. In quiet areas of the basin, fractures refreeze. To explore the fracture process during sustained deformation, we run 24-hour basin scale simulations at resolutions from 2.8 km to 14 km. At the end of each simulation we construct a distribution of floe areas. The cumulative distribution of floes at the large end of the distribution is approximately the same at each resolution. As we increase the resolution from 14 km to 2.8 km, the damage zones between large floes become more localized. A log-log plot of the cumulative floe size distributions obtained from the simulations appears linear over several orders of magnitude.},

The chemical shift in the static ESCA approach is a particularly powerful observable quantity for probing electron orbital energies in molecules in different molecular environments. Employing high harmonics of 800 nm (40 eV), near-infrared femtosecond pulses, and liquid-water microbeams in vacuum we were able to add the dimension of time to the liquid interface ESCA technique. Tracing time-dependent chemical shifts and energies of valence electrons in liquid interfacial water in time, we have investigated the timescale and molecular signatures of laser-induced liquid–gas phase transitions on a picosecond timescale.},

abstract = {Coulombic faulting, a concept formulated more than two centuries ago, still remains pertinent in describing the brittle compressive failure of various materials, including rocks and ice. Many questions remain, however, about the physical processes underlying this macroscopic phenomenology. This paper reviews the progress made in these directions during the past few years through the study of ice and its mechanical behaviour in both the laboratory and the field. Fault triggering is associated with the formation of specific features called comb-cracks and involves frictional sliding at the micro(grain)-scale. Similar mechanisms are observed at geophysical scales within the sea ice cover. This scale-independent physics is expressed by the same Coulombic phenomenology from laboratory to geophysical scales, with a very similar internal friction coefficient (mu approximate to 0.8). On the other hand, the cohesion strongly decreases with increasing spatial scale, reflecting the role of stress concentrators on fault initiation. Strong similarities also exist between ice and other brittle materials such as rocks and minerals and between faulting of the sea ice cover and Earth's crust, arguing for the ubiquitous nature of the underlying physics.},

abstract = {[1] We examined fracture features within arctic sea ice as revealed by Landsat-7 and RADARSAT imagery, by an aerial survey, and through observations in the laboratory of specimens loaded to brittle failure under biaxial compression. Regardless of scale, which spans the range from kilometers to millimeters, the features look alike. They consist mainly of narrow lineaments that traverse the field of view, plus wing-like and comb-like secondary cracks. The lineaments occasionally intersect and generally exhibit either right-lateral or left-lateral relative movement, like strike-slip faults within Earth's crust. We term them brittle compressive shear faults. They form through the linking of en echelon arrays of deformation-induced secondary cracks. From an application of wing-crack and comb-crack mechanics, we estimated the maximum compressive stress near the onset of faulting and found that our estimates compare favorably with in situ measurements by earlier investigators of ice sheet failure stresses. To account for the brittle behavior of the sea ice cover, we applied a recent model of the ductile-to-brittle transition in which the key idea is the competition between stress buildup and stress relaxation at stress concentrators. In identifying the nature of sea ice fracture features, we advance the view that failure occurs on many scales through highly localized as opposed to uniformly distributed deformation, via the operation of scale-independent mechanisms.},

abstract = {The brittle compressive fracture under uniaxial loading of fresh-water, granular ice Ih has been studied. Measurements are reported of the fracture stress at temperatures from -10 to -50??C at strain rates of 10-3 and 10-1 s-1 for grain sizes from approximately 1 to 10 mm. Also a summary is reported of measurements by Jones et al. (unpublished) of the kinetic coefficient of friction for ice on ice at temperatures from -10 to -40??C at sliding velocities from 5 ?? 10-7 m s-1 to 5 ?? 10-2 ms-1. Observations via high speed photography of internal cracking during loading are included. The strength, albeit scattered, increases with decreasing grain size, with decreasing temperature and at -10??C with decreasing strain rate. Similarly, the coefficient of friction increases with decreasing temperature and at -10??C with decreasing sliding velocity. Wing cracks were observed on some inclined cracks nucleated during loading. The results are explained in terms of the frictional crack sliding-wing crack model [as developed by Ashby and Hallam, Acta metall. 34, 497 (1986)] of compressive fracture. Finally, a simple model is presented for the transition from ductile to brittle behavior. It is based upon the competition between the building up and the relaxation of internal stresses within the vicinity of the internal cracks, and it leads to a transition strain rate which can be expressed in terms of the fracture toughness, the creep rate, the kinetic coefficient of friction and the microstructural scale of the material. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {A review of the structure and some properties of condensed phases of water is given. Since the discovery of the polymorphism of crystalline ice (beginning of the twentieth century), 15 ice modifications have been found and their structures have been determined. If we do not take into consideration proton ordering or disordering, nine distinct crystalline ice modifications in which water molecules retain their individuality are known. In the tenth, ice X, there are no H 2 O molecules. It contains ions (or atoms) of oxygen and hydrogen. The structure of all these modifications is described and information about their fields of stability and about the transition between them is given. It is emphasized that there are ice modifications which are metastable at any temperature and pressure (ices Ic, IV and XII), and many modifications can exist as metastable phases beyond their fields of stability. The ability of water to exist in metastable states is one of its remarkable properties. Several amorphous ice modifications (all of them are metastable) are known. Brief information about their properties and transitions between them is given. At the end of the 1960s the conception of the water structure as a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network was conclusively formed. Discovery of the polymorphism of amorphous ices awakened interest in the heterogeneity of the water network. Structural and dynamical heterogeneity of liquid water is discussed in detail. Computer simulation showed that the diffusion coefficient of water molecules in dense regions of the network is lower than in the loose regions, while an increase of density of the entire network gives rise to an increase of diffusion coefficient. This finding contradicts the conceptions associated with the primitive two-state models and can be explained from pressure dependences of melting temperature and of homogeneous nucleation temperature. A brief discussion of the picture of molecular motions in liquid water based on experiment and on computer simulation is given. This picture is still very incomplete. The most fascinating idea that was put forward during the last 20 years was the second critical point conjecture. It is still not clear whether this conjecture corresponds to reality.},

abstract = {Sea ice failure under low-confinement compression is modeled with a linear Coulombic criterion that can describe either fractural failure or frictional granular yield along slip lines. To study the effect of anisotropy we consider a simplified anisotropic sea ice model where the sea ice thickness depends on orientation. Accommodation of arbitrary deformation requires failure along at least two intersecting slip lines, which are determined by finding two maxima of the yield criterion. Due to the anisotropy these slip lines generally differ from the standard, Coulombic slip lines that are symmetrically positioned around the compression direction, and therefore different tractions along these slip lines give rise to a nonsymmetric stress tensor. We assume that the skewsymmetric part of this tensor is counterbalanced by an additional elastic stress in the sea ice field that suppresses floe spin. We consider the case of two leads initially formed in an isotropic ice cover under compression, and address the question of whether these leads will remain active or new slip lines will form under a rotation of the principal compression direction. Decoupled and coupled models of leads are considered and it is shown that for this particular case they both predict lead reactivation in almost the same way. The coupled model must, however, be used in determining the stress as the decoupled model does not resolve the stress asymmetry properly when failure occurs in one lead and at a new slip line.},

abstract = {Sea ice friction models are necessary to predict the nature of interactions between sea ice floes. These interactions are of interest on a range of scales, for example, to predict loads on engineering structures in icy waters or to understand the basin-scale motion of sea ice. Many models use Amonton's friction law due to its simplicity. More advanced models allow for hydrodynamic lubrication and refreezing of asperities; however, modeling these processes leads to greatly increased complexity. In this paper we propose, by analogy with rock physics, that a rate-and state-dependent friction law allows us to incorporate memory (and thus the effects of lubrication and bonding) into ice friction models without a great increase in complexity. We support this proposal with experimental data on both the laboratory (similar to 0.1 m) and ice tank (similar to 1 m) scale. These experiments show that the effects of static contact under normal load can be incorporated into a friction model. We find the parameters for a first-order rate and state model to be A = 0.310, B = 0.382, and mu(0) = 0.872. Such a model then allows us to make predictions about the nature of memory effects in moving ice-ice contacts.},

The Coulombic failure criterion was used to describe the observed linear relationship between the shear stress along and the normal stress across the fault. From this relationship the coefficient of friction was determined. At each temperature the coefficient of friction peaks at a transitional velocity (∼8×10−6ms−1). For a given velocity the coefficient of friction increases with decreasing temperature. We propose that the peaked shape of the coefficient of friction vs. sliding velocity graphs are a consequence of a change in sliding behavior from “ductile-like” at low velocities to “brittle-like” at higher velocities.

abstract = {[1] Frictional sliding plays a fundamental role in the deformation of the Arctic Ocean ice cover and in ice-structure interactions. To examine its character, sliding experiments were performed along freshly created Coulombic faults in first-year S2 sea ice harvested from the Beaufort Sea during the winters of 2003, 2007, and 2009. For comparison, and to complement experiments performed earlier, we also examined freshwater ice of similar microstructure. The principal variables were sliding velocity (from 8 × 10−7 m s−1 to 4 × 10−3 m s−1), temperature (−40°C, −10°C, and −3°C) and normal stress (from 0.02 to 2.7 MPa). Over the ranges explored, the coefficient of friction varies by a factor of four, from ∼0.4 to ∼1.6. The coefficient for both materials reaches a maximum value at an intermediate velocity, which is an order of magnitude higher for sea ice (∼10−4 m s−1) than for freshwater ice (∼10−5 m s−1). At lower velocities, sliding is characterized by velocity strengthening where, for a given velocity, the coefficient of friction of sea ice is lower than that of freshwater ice. At higher velocities, sliding is characterized by velocity weakening, where, for a given velocity, the coefficients of friction for sea ice is closer to that of freshwater ice. Velocity strengthening is explained in terms of creep deformation within contact zones along the fault. Velocity weakening is tentatively attributed to a combination of fracture and localized melting. An implication of stable versus unstable sliding is discussed for sea ice mechanics.},

We observe the formation of a thin liquid layer at the ice surface at temperatures below the melting point for all models and the three planes considered. For a given plane it was found that the thickness of a liquid layer was similar for different water models, when the comparison is made at the same undercooling with respect to the melting point of the model. The liquid layer thickness is found to increase with temperature. For a fixed temperature it was found that the thickness of the liquid layer decreases in the following order: the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane, and the secondary prismatic plane. For the TIP4P/Ice model, a model reproducing the experimental value of the melting temperature of ice, the first clear indication of the formation of a liquid layer, appears at about -100 degrees C for the basal plane, at about -80 degrees C for the primary prismatic plane, and at about -70 degrees C for the secondary prismatic plane.},

abstract = {The structure of the ice surface and its interaction with adsorbates are investigated by several experimental tools, combined with computer modeling. Spectroscopic features characteristic of icy surfaces were identified and assigned. Adsorbate spectroscopy is used to probe both the adsorbate layer and the ice surface structure. These results are potentially informative of basic questions, such as cooperative aspects of H-bonding and the mechanism of ice vaporization, and of diverse practical questions, such as the role of icy particles in atmospheric chemistry and physics as well as the chemistry of interstellar space. Methods are described for the preparation and spectroscopic study of microporous amorphous ice and cubic ice nanocrystals with surface to volume ratios that make it possible to obtain low-noise infrared and Raman spectra of the vibrational modes localized near the surfaces and of the fundamental modes of small molecule adsorbates. The assignment of the bands of several of the surface-localized modes is reported, on the basis of primarily the calculated vibrational excitations for simulated structures of both amorphous and crystalline ice. The usefulness of these spectra is enhanced by conversion to difference spectra that compare high surface area and low surface area samples. Bands have been assigned to each of the three important types of surface water molecules, as revealed by the simulated structures and spectra: molecules with non-H-bonded or dangling-H(D) atoms, molecules with a dangling-O coordination, and 4-coordinated surface water molecules. The experimental difference spectra have also been used to display the influence of small adsorbate molecules on surface-localized vibrations of each type of water molecule. This influence is apparent through the shifting and enhancement of bands of surface-localized modes, the response of the modes of the adsorbate molecules, and the determination of site-selective hears of adsorption of small molecules using the assigned ice modes. Computer modeling in conjunction with ab initio calculations was used to analyze and interpret adsorbate spectra and to elucidate the influence of factors such as the extent of surface disorder on gas-surface interactions. The results suggest significant modification of the ice surface structure with respect to the cubic crystalline interior, toward loss of lateral order.},

abstract = {We performed molecular dynamics calculations of surface of ice Ih in order to investigate formation mechanism of melting layer on the surface. The results showed that the vibrational amplitude of the atoms in the surface layer greatly depends on the crystal orientation, whereas that in the ice bulk is isotropic. The anisotropy of the vibration is due to a dangling motion of the free O-H bonds exist at the surface layer. The dangling motion enhances the rotational motion of the water molecules. The vibrational density of state showed a coupling between the rotational vibration and the lattice vibration of the water molecules in the surface layer. The coupling of the vibrations causes a distortion of ice lattice. Through the hydrogen-bonding network, the distortion transmits to the interior of the crystal. We conclude that the dangling motion of the free O-H bonds exist at the surface layer is one of the dominant factors governing the surface melting of ice crystal.},

abstract = {The ice-water interface plays an important role in determining the outcome of both biological and environmental processes. Under ambient pressure, the most stable form of ice is hexagonal ice (Ih). Experimentally probing the surface free energy between each of the major faces of Ih ice and the liquid is both experimentally and theoretically challenging. The basis for the challenge is the near-equality of the surface free energy for the major faces along with the tendency of water to supercool. As a result, morphology from crystallization initiated below 0 °C is kinetically controlled. The reported work circumvents supercooling consequences by providing a polycrystalline seed, followed by isothermal, equilibrium growth. Natural selection among seeded faces results in a single crystal. A record of the growth front is preserved in the frozen boule. Crystal orientation at the front is revealed by examining the boule cross section with two techniques: (1) viewing between crossed polarizers to locate the optical axis and (2) etching to distinguish the primary-prism face from the secondary-prism face. Results suggest that the most stable ice-water interface at 0 °C is the secondary-prism face, followed by the primary-prism face. The basal face that imparts the characteristic hexagonal shape to snowflakes is a distant third. The results contrast with those from freezing the vapor where the basal and primary-prism faces have comparable free energy followed by the secondary-prism face.},

abstract = {The effect of surface roughness, structure, and hydrophobicity on ice friction is studied systematically over a wide range of temperature and sliding speeds using several metallic interfaces. Hydrophobicity in combination with controlled roughness at the nanoscale is achieved by femtosecond laser irradiation to mimic the lotus effect on the slider's surface. The controlled roughness significantly increases the coefficient of friction at low sliding speeds and temperatures well below the ice melting point. However, at temperatures close to the melting point and relatively higher speeds, roughness and hydrophobicity significantly decrease ice friction. This decrease in friction is mainly due to the suppression of capillary bridges in spite of the presence of surface asperities that facilitate their formation. Finally, grooves oriented in the sliding direction also significantly decrease friction in the low velocity range compared to scratches and grooves randomly distributed over a surface.},

Ice friction between a metal slider and an ice surface, investigating slider surface roughness, structure, and hydrophobicity on the friction, over many temperatures and sliding speeds.

In the intro, Kietzig introduces the three kinds of friction regeimes, boundary, mixed, and hydrodynamic friction regeimes.

Used a steel slider, which was photo irradiated in order to control hydrophobicity. 

Increasing velocity of the slider was seen to decrease friction on the ice intially, then pass through a minimum, then increase slightly. The increase is thought to be attributed to the added drag of the capillary bridges formed between the ice and the slider after enough of the ice surface has become liquid like due to the frictional heating/melting of the suface.

abstract = {Abstract The temperature dependence of the habit of ice crystals growing in a water vapor diffusion chamber is related to the growth rate of ice crystals in a supercooled cloud. The rates of growth occurring between −4 and −6C as needles or between −12 and −16C as dendrites may be in excess of those at intermediate temperatures by as much as a factor of 100. The effect of seeding a supercooled cloud will therefore depend critically on its temperature. Growth of crystals at large supersaturation between −4 and −6C takes place as spikes growing along a direction 25° to the c axis. These crystals have been observed in the diffusion chamber, and also as frost near hot springs in Yellowstone Park. The molecular processes responsible for these habit changes are discussed.},

abstract = {The onset of surface melting of the basal plane (0001) face of TIP4P ice is studied in the temperature range T = 190-250 K using the molecular dynamics (MD) method. The disordering of the surface seen in the calculations can be explained in terms of the disruption of the hydrogen bonding network at the surface. At T = 210 K and lower the surface remains solid-like, as evidenced by non-zero order parameters and no calculable self-diffusion, although the reorientational correlation time (ca. 100 ps) is closer to that of the liquid than that of bulk ice. On the other hand, at T = 230 K (-43°C) and higher the surface is liquid-like, as shown by low order parameters and a high translational and rotational mobility of the molecules. At all temperatures, there is an orientational preference for the water molecule pointing its protons down, which is in agreement with experiment. The polarisation of the surface increases with increasing temperature. For the transition layer, the calculated reorientational correlation times are in rough agreement with NMR experiments, but for T ≥ 230 K the calculated self-diffusion coefficients are much higher than the values obtained in NMR experiments. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

"liquid like layer being of finite thickness (approx 30 angstroms) and additional liquid water should form droplets on the surface with non-zero contact angles."

Kroes measured "translational symmetry" by an order parameter with range (1,0.3) for (solid,liquid), which is based on recipricol space vectors of the oxygen lattice. He found at higher temperatures more of the surface layers approached 0.3.

Kroes measured "orientational ordering" by an order parameter with a range (1,0) for (solid,liquid). Again, he saw that the outter most layers of the crystal had a reduction in their overall ice-like ordering. At the warmest temperature, 250K, he saw that the top 6 most layers of the ice all were approximately liquid like (S{\_}{\{}T{\}} {\~{}} 0). For 230K, only the outter most two layers were shown to be liquid-like, the deeper layers retaining some of their crystallinity. 

Kroes found that on average, surface molecules were more likely to have their proton pointing down towards the surface. In conjunction with this, he observed the polarisation of the surface to increase with increasing temperature, in agreement with experiments by Mazzega (ref 16).},

These properties can be described by laws of corresponding states, so-called "melting rules". Melting and freezing takes place at the surface of crystals and at non-equilibrium conditions only. Crystals can be superheated, if the melting of the surface is suppressed. Light scattering experiments performed in situ during the freezing transition provide informations on density fluctuations and on molecular steps at the crystal surface. These experiments show that there is a layer of a mesophase inbetween solid and liquid at the conditions of freezing. Freezing is a cooperative process and can be characterized by a diffusion process in the interface layer. There is only one diffusion constant Di which describes self-diffusion as well as thermal diffusivity. Di is measured in the light scattering experiments and is used to calculate relative intensities of the scattered light and absolute crystallization rates in agreement with the experiments. ?? 1987.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18{\%} overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

abstract = {The shapes of growing crystals are determined by an interplay of complex processes that include transport of energy and matter through bulk phases, capillarity-related processes that determine local equilibrium conditions at the crystal-nutrient interface, and non-equilibrium kinetic processes that take place locally to that interface. A mathematical description of crystal growth results in a free boundary problem (the free boundary being the location and shape of the interface as a function of time) for thermal and compositional fields, governed by partial differential equations and subject to boundary conditions on the free boundary and at the extremities of the system. This free boundary problem is not only difficult to solve but often displays multiple solutions. One attempts to select from among the possible solutions by invoking principles of dynamic stability. By treating the above three processes in pairs, we show that the interplay of transport and interface kinetics leads to a consideration of facet instability; the interplay of diffusive transport and capillarity to morphological instability; and the interplay of capillarity and interface kinetics to a consideration of corner instability and to interesting modifications of the classical work of Frank that describes the evolution of crystal growth shapes under conditions for which capillary effects are negligible. Theories that treat all three processes simultaneously are rare, but numerical computations based on the boundary integral technique and the phase field model are beginning to yield interesting results, especially with respect to dendritic growth. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {A laboratory study of ice crystal growth characteristics at temperatures between Ϫ20Њ and Ϫ70ЊC has been performed at ice supersaturations and pressures comparable with those in the atmosphere using a horizontal static diffusion chamber. Maximum dimension, projected area, and volume growth rates, in addition to habit frequency, have been measured for individual habit types as functions of temperature, ice supersaturation, and air pressure. It was found that from Ϫ20Њ to Ϫ40ЊC and at ice supersaturations in excess of 2{\%}, the most frequent habits observed were platelike polycrystals and plates, the complexity of forms increasing with in-creasing supersaturation. Columns appear with low frequency in this temperature range for all supersaturations. At low ice supersaturation (1{\%}–2{\%}), the habit consists of thick plates, compact polycrystals, and occasional short columns and is the region with the highest frequency of pristine crystals capable of producing halos. Just colder than Ϫ40ЊC, there is a marked shift to columnar behavior except at low to moderate ice super-saturation (Ͻ10{\%}) where the habit is essentially the same as at warmer temperatures with a small increase in the frequency of short columns. At moderate ice supersaturation (10{\%}–25{\%}), long solid columns and polycrystals with columnar and platelike components are observed. Above approximately 25{\%} ice supersaturation, bullet rosettes, long columns, and column-containing polycrystals are observed, the frequency of bullet rosettes and columns increasing with increasing ice supersaturation. At Ϫ60ЊC and colder, needle forms appear along with columnar forms. These characteristics are portrayed in a habit diagram as a function of temperature and ice supersaturation and are essentially in agreement with the vast majority of atmospheric in situ observations at these temperatures, both of which depart from the previous habit diagrams at temperatures colder than Ϫ20ЊC compiled by Kobayashi, Magono and Lee, and Hallett and Mason. Habit growth rates and habit frequencies have been measured at 10Њ temperature increments. Exponential fits of these results yield functions that can be used to estimate growth rates and habit distributions at intermediate temperatures for ice supersaturations as low as 1{\%} up to the maximum values, which might be encountered in the atmosphere due to ventilation effects, approximately up to 50{\%} above water saturation between Ϫ25Њ and Ϫ40ЊC and extrapolated water saturation colder than Ϫ40ЊC. Within each habit and under identical growth conditions, observed extremes in growth rates for individual crystals in comparison with average values show variances of Ϯ50{\%}, reflecting a variance in aspect ratio that suggests a critical role of crystalline defects in growth characteristics. These results indicate an even more complex behavior of ice crystal habit than that observed between 0Њ and Ϫ20ЊC, a behavior that depends not only on temperature and ice supersaturation, but also on vapor diffusivity, related to air pressure, and the initial nucleation process.},

abstract = {In contrast to crystalline solids--for which a precise framework exists for describing structure--quantifying structural order in liquids and glasses has proved more difficult because even though such systems possess short-range order, they lack long-range crystalline order. Some progress has been made using model systems of hard spheres, but it remains difficult to describe accurately liquids such as water, where directional attractions (hydrogen bonds) combine with short-range repulsions to determine the relative orientation of neighbouring molecules as well as their instantaneous separation. This difficulty is particularly relevant when discussing the anomalous kinetic and thermodynamic properties of water, which have long been interpreted qualitatively in terms of underlying structural causes. Here we attempt to gain a quantitative understanding of these structure-property relationships through the study of translational and orientational order in a models of water. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a structurally anomalous region--bounded by loci of maximum orientational order (at low densities) and minimum translational order (at high densities)--in which order decreases on compression, and where orientational and translational order are strongly coupled. This region encloses the entire range of temperatures and densities for which the anomalous diffusivity and thermal expansion coefficient of water are observed, and enables us to quantify the degree of structural order needed for these anomalies to occur. We also find that these structural, kinetic and thermodynamic anomalies constitute a cascade: they occur consecutively as the degree of order is increased.},

We also study the connectivity of those molecules with four intact hydrogen bonds, and compare the corresponding distribution functions with correlated‐site percolation theory. Our analysis supports the proposal that when looking at the b o n d connectivity, water appears as a macroscopic space‐filling network—as expected from continuum models of water. When looking at the correlated s i t epercolation problem defined by the four‐bonded molecules, water appears as a myriad of tiny ramified low‐density patches, somewhat reminiscent of mixture theories and cluster models. In Appendix A, we find a strong correlation between the number of molecules within a sphere of radius r c around a given molecule and the total interaction energy of that molecule with its neighbors residing in that sphere; for most choices of r c , the energy becomes less negative when more molecules are in the sphere, in contrast to the behavior of a normal fluid. This result supports the finding of Geiger and Stanley that regions of h i g h bond connectivity are correlated with regions of l o w density. In Appendix B we describe in detail how we adapt conventional percolation theory to the calculation of cluster size distribution functions for hydrogen bondnetworks in water.},

abstract = {The effects of including the Ewald sum on several key system properties for the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model of water, in the temperature range of 140-300 K have been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The original SPC/E parameters are used without alteration since this study is intended to determine whether the Ewald sum affects the model sufficiently to warrant reparameterization. Overall comparison to experiment has been improved for the liquid phase as evidenced by several factors. The effect of temperature on the self-diffusivity coefficient has improved in the range from 300 to 200 K. There is a shift in the temperature at which the density maximum occurs (260 K from 255 K in previous simulations of SPC/E water without the Ewald) and the value of rho(max) has decreased to 1.0003 g/ml (versus 0.99997 g/ml for experiment at 277 K) from 1.0082 g/ml for the SPC/E model. However, the shape of the rho(T) profile is worse than without the Ewald sum in comparison to experiment, but is qualitatively similar to Monte Carlo data from Harrington for SPC/E modeled water including a reaction field method. For the solid, while the rho(T) profile is unchanged, values are worse than without an Ewald sum in comparison to experiment (approximate to3{\%} higher than experiment without the Ewald and approximate to5{\%} with the Ewald). Calculation of free energies of various low pressure ices and liquid water using thermodynamic integration has produced the major finding, the determination of a melting point for low pressure ices. The melting points of proton-disordered ices I-h and I-c were found to be 279+/-5 K and 291+/-5 K, respectively. Melting points of their proton-ordered counterparts are 284+/-5 K (I-h) and 281+/-5 K (I-c) (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

The 3 surfaces include a flat hydrophobic surface, an at. rough hydrophobic surface, and a contrasting, hydrophilic, fully hydroxylated silica surface.  The results of anal. show that, as expected, the solvent near each of the 2 hydrophobic surfaces behaves essentially equivalently, with loss of H bonding at the interface.  For the hydroxylated surface, surface-solvent H bonding is stronger than interactions in the bulk solvent, with the nearest solvent layer interacting specifically with ≤ 3 surface hydroxyl groups.  Nevertheless, distinct structural perturbation of the solvent extends in every case no more than ∼ 10 {\AA} from the surface, and the perturbation is only strong in the immediate solvation layer.  Furthermore, the corresponding dynamic perturbation of the solvent (as measured by the diffusion rates and reorientation times in comparison to the bulk) is always relatively small.  For the hydrophilic case, it is largest, but even so is a factor {\textless} 5 at the immediate interface and a factor {\textless} 2 in the 2nd hydration layer.  The residence time for solvent at the interface is insensitive to the hydrophilicity of the surface.  Calcd.

abstract = {With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. They are both examples of "functional data", which have become a prevailing type of data. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool and in sparse data situations can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single or multiple index methods we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models, such as time warping, manifold learning, and dynamic modeling with empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

abstract = {The onset mechanism of frictional sliding is essential in understanding frictional strength between materials. In particular, the static friction coefficient is a very important but often overlooked indicator for the emergency braking performance of tyres. In ABS braking a significant area of the tyre contact patch is locally stuck to the road and becomes detached to frictional sliding when the local shear stresses exceed the local friction potential. The detachment phenomena were studied for rubber-ice contact by means of a high-speed camera and image processing. The image sequences of the contact were combined with friction force data. It was observed that for a smooth rubber sample a horseshoe-shaped detachment front was produced. The last contact point was always at the trailing edge or side of the sample. The textured sample had a ring-like detachment front that located the last contact point in the centre of the contact area. The dwell time had a logarithmic dependency on the static friction of the rubber-ice contact. Two different types of precursors were found. The first precursor occurred when the first signs of detachment were observed visually. The second precursor was found when the static friction rose so high that the movement of the sample was nucleated by the breaking of the ice rather than the detachment of the contact.},

Furthermore, the so-called saturation of the rough rubber surface is taken into account. Compared to experiments, the numerically determined friction coefficient represents the influence of pressure, velocity, and ice temperature qualitatively correct. Moreover, the effect of rubber stiffness is in agreement with experimental studies in general.

abstract = {The constant need to improve road safety and the driving performance of winter tires imposes challenging requirements on tire development, especially when considering that one of the key steps, the evaluation of the product itself, is limited by the seasonal changes. This explains why the industry is moving towards indoor testing. An example is the ice performance of tires, which is very frequently characterized indoors or even in the laboratory. The quality of the data thus obtained, however, depends strongly on how well the artificial surface approximates real life. Today, several methods are available to assure the consistency of the test data by controlling the creation and the break-in of the ice track used for testing. At the same time what happens at the surface during its preparation and how this affects the physics of the rubber-ice contact is not yet fully understood. To build this understanding, in the work reported here we were focusing on one of the simplest experiments available. Series of linear friction tests were performed in the laboratory with strict environmental and procedural control. The quasi-real-time microstructural monitoring of the ice surface, together with the friction measurements, allowed the main physical processes that were ongoing during the break-in of the fresh or aged ice surfaces and led to changes in the contact conditions to be identified. The results indicated that there was no large-scale melting of the ice when the rubber was sliding over it. The deformation of the ice and its strong dependency on temperature, on the other hand, may play a significant role in ice friction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {[1] New measurements have been made of the friction coefficient of freshwater polycrystalline ice sliding slowly (5 × 10−8 to 1 × 10−3 m s−1) upon itself at temperatures from 98 to 263 K under low normal stresses (≤98 kPa). Sliding obeys Coulomb's law: the shear stress is directly proportional to the normal stress across the interface, while cohesion offers little contribution to frictional resistance. The coefficient of kinetic friction of smooth surfaces varies from $\mu$k = 0.15 to 0.76 and, at elevated temperatures (≥223 K), exhibits both velocity strengthening at lower velocities ({\textless}10−5 to 10−4 m s−1) and velocity weakening at higher velocities. Strengthening and weakening are attributed to creep deformation of asperities and localized melting, respectively. At intermediate temperatures of 173 and 133 K, the kinetic coefficient appears to not exhibit significant dependence upon velocity. However, at the low temperature of 98 K the coefficient of kinetic friction exhibits moderate velocity strengthening at both the lowest and the highest velocities but velocity independence over the range of intermediate velocities. No effect was detected of either grain size or texture. Over the range of roughness 0.4 × 10−6 m ≤ Ra ≤ 12 × 10−6 m, a moderate effect was detected, where $\mu$k ∝ Ra0.08. Slide-hold-slide experiments revealed that the coefficient of static friction increases by an amount that scales logarithmically with holding time. Implications of the results are discussed in relation to shearing across “tiger stripe” faults within the icy crust of Saturn's Enceladus, sliding of the arctic sea ice cover and brittle compressive failure of cold ice.},

abstract = {Friction processes for ice on carbon-black filled styrene butadiene rubber have been investigated by observing wear and debris morphology on wear surfaces using low temperature scanning electron microscopy (LT-SEM) and correlating the features with sliding velocity and temperature. Friction experiments were carried out over a velocity range of 0.003 m s-1 to 2.6 m s-1 and a temperature range of -33 °C to -0.5 °C and the results used to form a friction map. Observation of worn surfaces at high velocity showed melt films that result from frictional heating. At low velocities and low temperatures morphologies indicative of much drier contact were seen. At higher temperatures and low velocity there is evidence of liquid films that we propose arise from the salt content of the ice. High friction ($\mu$ ∼ 1) at low velocity and at temperatures around -25 °C was caused by the internal friction associated with the rubber glass transition. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We have indented the surface of ice at temperatures between 21 °C and 217 °C with sharp atomic force microscope tips. For a thick viscous interfacial melt layer, a Newtonian treatment of the ﬂow of quasiliquid between the tip and the ice suggests that indentations at different indentation velocities should have the same force/velocity ratio for a given pit depth. This is observed for silicon tips with and without a hydrophobic coating at temperatures between 21 °C and 210 °C implying the presence of a liquid-like layer at the interface between tip and ice. At temperatures below about 210 °C the dependence of force on velocity is weaker, suggesting that plastic ﬂow of the ice dominates. A simple model for viscous ﬂow that incorporates the approximate shape of our tip is used to obtain an estimate of the layer thickness, assuming the layer has the viscosity of supercooled water. The largest layer thicknesses inferred from this model are too thin to be described by continuum mechanics, but the model ﬁts the data well. This suggests that the viscosity of the conﬁned quasiliquid is much greater than that of bulk supercooled water. The hydrophobically coated tip has a signiﬁcantly thinner layer than the uncoated tip, but the dependence of thickness on temperature is similar. The estimated viscous layer thickness increases with increasing temperature as expected for a quasiliquid premelt layer.},

However, revealing the dynamic behavior of quasi-liquid layers (QLLs), which governs the surface properties of ice crystals at temperatures near the melting point, remains an experimental challenge. Here we show that two types of QLL phases appear that exhibit different morphologies and dynamics. We directly visualized the two types of QLLs on ice crystal surfaces by advanced optical microscopy, which can visualize the individual 0.37-nm-thick elementary steps on ice crystal surfaces. We found that they had different stabilities and different interactions with ice crystal surfaces. The two immiscible QLL phases appeared heterogeneously, moved around, and coalesced dynamically on ice crystal surfaces. This picture of surface melting is quite different from the conventional picture in which one QLL phase appears uniformly on ice crystal surfaces.},

Several frictional processes were identified based on the evolution of ice surface morphology. The nature of rubber-ice contact is significantly different for softer and stiffer rubber compounds. For softer compounds the ice microstructure evolves through frost rounding/removal, surface scratching by hard filler plowing, and shearing of quasi-liquid layer by capillary drag. Cold recrystallization and local melting/refreezing of ice was not found to occur owing to homogenous pressure distribution. For stiffer compounds, the pressure distribution is uneven and contact is more localized, resulting in enhanced local deformation features such as subgrain boundaries, visible etch pits and large-scale melting/refreezing.},

Important aspects of these phenomena in engineering, winter sports and the natural environment are considered. We report new results for static and dynamic friction of a metal (steel) and a polymer (PMMA) on ice over a range of temperatures (−3 to −13 °C), and interpret the behaviour by considering processes that operate at the interface and in the bulk of the materials. Clearly the chemical and thermomechanical properties of steel, PMMA and ice differ. The thermomechanical properties of ice itself also vary within the temperature range examined. We find higher static friction with increasing time, and a curious difference in the behaviour of the metal and polymer with temperature. We explain the results by considering the materials' stiffness, plastic deformation and creep, the ductile/brittle transition in ice, thermal properties, physicochemical properties of the surfaces and the real area of contact.},

abstract = {Although the study of friction has a long history, ice friction has only been investigated during the last century. The basic physical concepts underlying the different friction regimes, such as boundary, mixed, and hydrodynamic friction are also relevant to ice friction. However, these friction regimes must be described with respect to the thickness of the lubricating liquidlike layer on ice. In this review the state of knowledge on the physics of ice friction is discussed. Surface melting theories are introduced. These theories attempt to explain the existence and nature of the liquidlike surface layer on ice at any temperature and without any load applied. Pressure melting, as the long-time explanation for the ease of ice friction, is discussed, together with the prevailing theory of frictional heating. The various laboratory setups for ice friction measurements are presented as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The individual influence of the different parameters on the coefficient of ice friction is discussed; these include the effects of temperature, sliding velocity, normal force exerted by the sliding object, the contact area between ice and slider, relative humidity, and also properties of the slider material such as surface roughness, surface structure, wettability, and thermal conductivity. Finally, the most important ice friction models based on the frictional heating theory are briefly introduced and research directions on the subject of ice friction are discussed},

@article{Persson2015,
abstract = {The low friction of ice is usually attributed to the formation of a thin water film due to melting of ice by frictional heating. Melting of ice is a first order phase transition where physical quantities like mass density, the elastic modulus or the shear strength changes abruptly at the transition temperature. Thus, one may expect the friction coefficient to change abruptly at some characteristic sliding speed, when the melt water film is produced. We show that taking into account that, due to non-uniform frictional heating, melting does not occur simultaneously in all the ice contact regions, the transition is not abrupt but still more rapid (as a function of sliding speed) than observed experimentally. The slower than expected drop in the friction with increasing sliding speed may be a consequence of the following paradoxical phenomena: before the melt-water film is formed, the friction of ice is high and a large frictional heating occur which may result in the melting of the ice. If a thin (nanometer) water film would form, the friction becomes low which results in small frictional heating and the freezing of the water film. This suggests a region in sliding speed where a thin (nanometer) surface layer of the ice may be in a mixed state with small ice-like and water-like domains, which fluctuate rapidly in space and time. Alternatively, and more likely, heat-softening of the ice may occur resulting in a thin, statistically homogeneous (in the lateral direction) layer of disordered ice, with a shear strength which decreases continuously as the ice surface temperature approaches the bulk melting temperature. This layer could be related to surface premelting of ice. Using a phenomenological expression for the frictional shear stress, I show that the calculated ice friction is in good agreement with experimental observations.},

Depending on the kind of intermolecular interactions, the vibrational dynamics of the particles can be strongly influenced by intrinsic particle properties such as size, shape, or surface area. Such phenomena are discussed for several examples. In contrast, for some substances the vibrational spectra are mainly governed by local effects, i.e. by the interaction of neighboring molecules. The comparison of the experimental results with different model calculations leads to a deeper insight into the microscopic origin of the characteristic patterns observed. The vibrational dynamics are studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In addition, the particle properties are characterized by microscopy and measurements of the size distribution. Four different particle generation methods are discussed. It is shown that the methods of generation can even influence the chemical composition of the particles.},

Through molecular dynamics simulations and an analytic jump reorientation model, we identify the water reorientation mechanism next to a hydrophobic solute and provide evidence that no water molecules are immobilized by hydrophobic solutes. Their moderate rotational slowdown compared to bulk water (e.g., by a factor of less than 2 at low solute concentration) is mainly due to slower hydrogen-bond exchange. The slowdown is quantitatively described by a solute excluded volume effect at the transition state for the key hydrogen-bond exchange in the reorientation mechanism. We show that this picture is consistent with both ultrafast anisotropy and NMR experimental results and that the transition state excluded volume theory yields quantitative predictions of the rotational slowdown for diverse hydrophobic solutes of varying size over a wide concentration range. We also explain why hydrophobic groups slow water reorientation less than do some hydrophilic groups.},

We evidence that for most solutes the major effect in the hydration dynamics comes from the hydrophilic groups. These groups can retard the water dynamics much more significantly than can hydrophobic groups by forming strong hydrogen bonds with water. By contrast, hydrophobic groups are shown to have a very moderate effect on water hydrogen bond breaking kinetics. We also present the first calculation of the 2D IR spectra for these solutions. While 2D IR spectroscopy is a powerful technique to probe water hydrogen bond network fluctuations, interpretations of aqueous solution spectra remain ambiguous. We show that a complementary approach through simulations and calculation of the spectra lifts the ambiguity and provides a clear connection between the simulated molecular picture and the experimental spectroscopy data. For amphiphilic solute solutions, we show that, in contrast with techniques such as NMR or ultrafast anisotropy, 2D IR spectroscopy can discriminate between waters next to the solutes hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. We also evidence that the water dynamics slowdown due to the hydrophilic groups is dramatically enhanced in the 2D IR spectral relaxation, because these groups can induce a slow chemical exchange with the bulk, even when recognized exchange signatures are absent. Implications for the understanding of water around chemically heterogeneous systems such as protein surfaces and for the interpretation of 2D IR spectra in these cases are discussed.},

We especially highlight the critical role played by hydrophilic HB acceptors: the strength of the HB formed with water has a pronounced effect on the HB dynamics, in accord with several experimental observations. In contrast, we evidence that hydrophilic HB donors induce a moderate slowdown in the water HB exchange dynamics due to an excluded volume effect, similar to that of hydrophobic groups. We present an analytic model which rationalizes the effect of all examined amino acid sites on the HB dynamics and whose predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations. This model provides the acceleration or retardation in the HB exchange time with respect to the bulk through the combination of the solute excluded volume factor with the solute-water HB strength factor, both referring to the HB exchange transition state.},

abstract = {The dynamics of water are dramatically modified upon confinement in nanoscale hydrophilic silica pores. In particular, the OH reorientation dynamics of the interfacial water are non-exponential and dramatically slowed relative to the bulk liquid. A detailed analysis of molecular dynamics simulations is carried out to elucidate the microscopic origins of this behavior. The results are analyzed in the context of the extended jump model for water that describes the reorientation as a combination of hydrogen-bond exchanges, or jumps, and rotation of intact hydrogen bonds, with the former representing the dominant contribution. Within this model, the roles of surface and dynamical heterogeneities are considered by spatially resolving the hydrogen-bond jump dynamics into individual sites on the silica pore surface. For each site the dynamics is nearly mono-exponential, indicating that dynamical heterogeneity is at most a minor influence, while the distribution of these individual site jump times is broad. The non-exponential dynamics can also not be attributed to enthalpic contributions to the barriers to hydrogen-bond exchanges. Two entropic effects related to the surface roughness are found to explain the retarded and diverse dynamics: those associated with the approach of a new hydrogen-bond acceptor and with the breaking of the initial hydrogen-bond.},

abstract = {The reorganization of water's hydrogen-bond (HB) network by breaking and making HBs lies at the heart of many of the pure liquid's special features and many aqueous media phenomena, including chemical reactions, ion transport and protein activity. An essential role in this reorganization is played by water molecule reorientation, long described by very small angular displacement Debye rotational diffusion. A markedly contrasting picture has been recently proposed, based on simulation and analytic modeling: a sudden, large amplitude jump mechanism, in which the reorienting water molecule rapidly exchanges HB partners in an activated process which has all the hallmarks of a chemical reaction. In this contribution, we offer a brief review of the jump mechanism together with a discussion of its application to, and probing by, modern ultrafast infrared spectroscopy experiments. Special emphasis is given to the direct characterization of the jumps via pioneering two-dimensional infrared spectroscopic measurements. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The hydration layer surrounding a protein plays an essential role in its biochemical function and consists of a heterogeneous ensemble of water molecules with different local environments and different dynamics. What determines the degree of dynamical heterogeneity within the hydration shell and how this changes with temperature remains unclear. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and analytic modeling to study the hydration shell structure and dynamics of a typical globular protein, ubiquitin, and of the spruce budworm hyperactive antifreeze protein over the 230-300 K temperature range. Our results show that the average perturbation induced by both proteins on the reorientation dynamics of water remains moderate and changes weakly with temperature. The dynamical heterogeneity arises mostly from the distribution of protein surface topographies and is little affected by temperature. The ice-binding face of the antifreeze protein induces a short-ranged enhancement of water structure and a greater slowdown of water reorientation dynamics than the non-ice-binding faces whose effect is similar to that of ubiquitin. However, the hydration shell of the ice-binding face remains less tetrahedral than the bulk and is not "ice-like". We finally show that the hydrogen bonds between water and the ice-binding threonine residues are particularly strong due to a steric confinement effect, thereby contributing to the strong binding of the antifreeze protein on ice crystals.},

Molecular dynamics simulations and analytical models are used to access site-resolved information on hydration shell dynamics and to elucidate the molecular origins of the dynamical perturbation of hydration shell water relative to bulk water. We show that all four proteins have very similar hydration shell dynamics, despite their wide range of sizes and functions, and differing secondary structures. We demonstrate that this arises from the similar local surface topology and surface chemical composition of the four proteins, and that such local factors alone are sufficient to rationalize the hydration shell dynamics. We propose that these conclusions can be generalized to a wide range of globular proteins. We also show that protein conformational fluctuations induce a dynamical heterogeneity within the hydration layer. We finally address the effect of confinement on hydration shell dynamics via a site-resolved analysis and connect our results to experiments via the calculation of two-dimensional infrared spectra.},

The H-bon cleavage and the molecular reorientation occur concertedly and not successively as usually considered, and the mechanism involves large-amplitude angular jumps, not small sucessive steps.

The flipping of H* from Oa -{\textgreater} Ob occurs in approx. 250fs. The jump only takes place when the two Oa,b are equidistant from O* (the oxygen bonded to the jumping hydrogen H*)

Since the Oa (first solvation shell) and Ob (second solvation shell) must become equidistant to O*, this is driven by fluctuations in the Hbonding network of the bulk.

The 5-coordinate rotating water molecule is the transition state of the mechanism. 

The mechanism can be related to orientational relaxation times by the Ivanov jump model, which assumes water molecules to be isotropic spheres, and requires to parameters as input into the model.

2. the frequency of the jumps. (extracted by plotting the reactive correlation function)

In contrast, the dynamics of water in the hydrophobic pore are more modestly affected. A two-state model, commonly used to interpret confined liquid properties, is tested by analysis of the position-dependence of the water dynamics.

The water reorientation is shown to occur through large-amplitude angular jumps due to the exchange of hydrogen (H)-bond acceptors, with a minor contribution from the diffusive H-bond frame reorientation between these exchanges. The robust character of this mechanism with respect to different water models is discussed. We fully characterize these jump events, including the distributions of trajectories around the average path. The average path values and the distributions of the jump time and the jump amplitude, the two key parameters in the Ivanov jump model component of the EJM, are determined. We also discuss the possibility of selectively exciting water molecules close to the jump event, of interest for ultrafast infrared experiments. In addition to a comparison of predicted reorientation times with experimental results, the reorientation time temperature dependence is discussed. A detailed description of the pathway free energetics for the water reorientation is presented; this is used to identify the jump rate-limiting step as the translational motion in which the initial H-bond of the reorientating water is elongated and the new H-bond acceptor water approaches.},

abstract = {There are fundamental and not yet fully resolved questions concerning the impact of solutes, ions in particular, on the structure and dynamics of water, which can be formulated as follows: Are the effects of ions local or long-ranged? Is the action of cations and anions on water cooperative or not? Here, we investigate how the reorientation and hydrogen-bond dynamics of water are affected by ions in dilute and concentrated aqueous salt solutions. By combining simulations and analytic modeling, we first show that ions have a short-ranged influence on the reorientation of individual water molecules and that depending on their interaction strength with water, they may accelerate or slow down water dynamics. A simple additive picture combining the effects of the cations and anions is found to provide a good description in dilute solutions. In concentrated solutions, we show that the average water reorientation time ceases to scale linearly with salt concentration due to overlapping hydration shells and structural rearrangements which reduce the translational displacements induced by hydrogen-bond switches and increase the solution viscosity. This effect is not ion-specific and explains why all concentrated salt solutions slow down water dynamics. Our picture, which is demonstrated to be robust vis-a-vis a change in the force-field, reconciles the seemingly contradictory experimental results obtained by ultrafast infrared and NMR spectroscopies, and suggests that there are no long-ranged cooperative ion effects on the dynamics of individual water molecules in dilute solutions.},

abstract = {Liquid water is remarkably labile in reorganizing its hydrogen-bond (HB) network through the breaking and forming of HBs. This rapid restructuring, which occurs on the picosecond time scale, is critical not only for many of the pure liquid's special features but also for a range of aqueous media phenomena, including chemical reactions and protein activity. An essential part of the HB network reorganization is water molecule reorientation, which has long been described as Debye rotational diffusion characterized by very small angular displacements. Recent theoretical work, however, has presented a starkly contrasting picture: a sudden, large-amplitude jump mechanism, in which the reorienting water molecule rapidly exchanges HB partners in what amounts to an activated chemical reaction. In this Account, we first briefly review the jump mechanism and then discuss how it is supported by a series of experiments. These studies range from indirect indications to direct characterization of the jumps through pioneering two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR), the power of which accords it a special focus here. The scenarios in which experimental signatures of the jump mechanism are sought increase in complexity throughout the Account, beginning with pure water. Here 2D-IR in combination with theory can give a glimpse of the jumps, but the tell-tale markers are not pronounced. A more fruitful arena is provided by aqueous ionic solutions. The difference between water-water and water-anion HB strengths provides the experimental handle of differing OH stretch frequencies; in favorable cases, the kinetic exchange of a water between these two sites can be monitored. Sole observation of this exchange, however, is insufficient to establish the jump mechanism. Fortunately, 2D-IR with polarized pulses has demonstrated that HB exchange is accompanied by significant angular displacement, with an estimated jump angle similar to theoretical estimates. The Janus-like character of amphiphilic solutes, with their hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces, presents a special challenge for theory and experiment. Here a consensus on the 2D-IR interpretation has not yet been achieved; this lack of accord impedes the understanding of, for example, biochemical solutes and interfaces. We argue that the influence of hydrophobic groups on water jumps is only modest and well accounted for by an excluded volume effect in the HB exchange process. Conversely, hydrophilic groups have an important influence when their HB strength with water differs significantly from that of the water-water HB. The power of 2D-IR is argued to be accompanied by subtleties that can lead to just the opposite and, in our view, erroneous conclusion. We close with a prediction that a hydrophobic surface offers an arena in which the dynamics of "dangling" water OHs, bereft of a HB, could provide a 2D-IR confirmation of water jumps.},

The comparison of concentrated aqueous solutions of tetramethylurea, which tends to aggregate, and of trimethylamine N-oxide, which does not, shows the dramatic impact of solute clustering on the water dynamics. No significant decoupling of the reorientation and translation dynamics of water is observed, even at very high solute concentrations. The respective roles of energetic and topological disorders in determining the translational subdiffusive water dynamics in these confining environments are discussed.

Through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and analytic modeling, we provide a molecular interpretation of this behavior. We show that this non-monotonic dependence arises from two competing effects induced by the increasing surface hydrophilicity: first a change in the hydration structure with an enhanced population of water OH bonds pointing toward the surface and second a strengthening of the water-surface interaction energy.

Analyzing the likelihood of a water molcule to have 4 nearest-neighbors, a profile of how "ice-like" the molecules are by z was constructed. They show that the basal has a broad transition from ice-like to liquid like, while prismatic has a very sharp interface.

They observed slices normal to the interface (for both basal and prismatic), containing solid-like and liquid-like molecules based on tracking their motion.

Diffusion somewhat close to the interface was observed to be faster for the basal ice/water system than in the prismatic ice/water system.

By tracking the number of molecules which are captured onto ice lattice sites, Nada concluded that the Basal interface structure is smoother, while the Prismatic interface is geometrically rougher.

Since the growth rate of the basal plane requires two-dimensional nucleation, we expect slower growth from that plane. On the other hand, since prismatic interface does not require a nucleation event, we expect faster growth rates at this interface.},

abstract = {Molecular-scale structures of the basal and prismatic faces of an ice crystal are investigated using a molecular dynamics simulation. Simulations are carried out over a temperature range, from 170 to 250 K. The simulation results clearly indicate that structural transitions occur, at least twice, on both faces as the temperature increases to the melting point. The transitions are (1) a transition from a molecularly flat surface to a surface with admolecules, and (2) a transition from a surface with admolecules to a melted surface (i.e. surface melting). The temperatures of these structural transitions, however, are completely different in the case of basal and prismatic faces. These anisotropic structural transitions are explained by the difference between the energetic states of surfaces and between the molecular arrangements of these faces. Moreover, the anisotropy in surface melting between the faces, which agrees with the experimental results, is obtained. The anisotropic surface melting is discussed on the basis of the interface structures between the surface-melted layer and the underlying ice.},
annote = {Basal and prismatic ice/vacuum/QLL interfaces studied here. T ranging over 170-250K. Both faces exhibit two transitions along the path of surface melting. 1) the molecularly flat surface has the advent of admolecules. 2) admolecules to a melted state.

TIP4P water model.

To determine if surface structures obtained here were equilibrium structures, they just ran the sim for about 0.8 ns and watched to see if they would remain. Also performed two different simulations (starting from different initial velocities) and obtained the same equilibrium structure, aka confirmation.

Here, Nada estimates the melting temperature of ice Ih for the TIP4P model to be 250K or higher, since this is where they observe stable surface structures. He points towards Vlot's recent paper (ref 37) in which free energy calculations are performed on ice Ih using the TIP4P model for water and obtains a melting temperature of 214K. Vlot indicates that choice of cut-off radius and potential switching function both can highly influence this melting temperature.

At 185K, admolecules are seen to appear on the Basal ice surface. This was tracked by oxygen distribution by z-dimension. Kroes (10) recently saw a similar phonomena. This peak on the number density profile dissappears around 215K, indicating another structural transition has occurred. 

By viewing the Basal surface at 185K, a few water molecules were found to have reoriented in their lattice position. This indicates that the precurser to forming the admolcules might be reorientation at the lattice position. Peak lives from 185K-210K.

In the Prismatic surface, the peak in layer 0 forms at 180K-215K. the peak is also sharper, denoting a closer hold to the admolecules (more defined layer).

Energetics of the surface molecules of the Basal and Prismatic surfaces show that the Basal surface is more stable than that of the prismatic surface. 

The anisotropy in the surface melting transition temperature is due to the difference between the molecular arragements (and number of hydrogen bonds between the surface and the admolecules) formed in the two systems.

Basal QLL was found to be thicker than the Prismatic QLL. Using a root mean square distance between oxygen atoms, the QLLs were estimated to be 12.0 and 9.8 angstroms for the basal and prismatic surfaces, respectively.

Cite (12,43) for "environmental conditions in simulation and experiments might affect the values of qll width" as to why qll here is much smaller than obtained experimentally.

By tracking hydrogen-bond lifetimes in the QLL, Nada observed the Prismatic QLL to have on average longer-hydrogen bond lifetimes (ie, more solid structure) than the Basal QLL. 

Nada attributes the same differences of the ice/water interface to be those for the ice/qll interface},

Anisotropic growth observed (through interpretation of the g{\_}{\{}OO{\}}(r), second and third peak growth over time, the prismatic/water interface was found to grow collectively, while the basal/water interface was found to grow layer by layer), and translational and orientational ordering advancing from the ice through the interface during crystal growth is discussed.

TIP4P water model

Nada finds the Prismatic interface to be much rougher than the Basal. However, this contradicts Hayward01 in which they find the equilibrium interface for the Basal to be wider than that of the Prismatic.

By comparing g{\_}{\{}OO{\}}(r) for the basal/water interface, with the g{\_}{\{}OH{\}}(r), they determine that the translational ordering of the interface is locked-in earlier than the orientational ordering. The same is found for the prismatic/water interface. This is logical, since the diffusion of molecules becomes limited at cold temperatures and the molecules become trapped in ice-like environments, however, the molecules are still able to easily reorient themselves, and thus the orientational ordering may take longer to setlle down.},

From the 10-90 widths of , the order of the interfaces from thickets to thinnest is basal, prism, secprism, pyramidal range of (9.9, 6.6) {\AA}. Comparison with other rigid water models shows that the flexible CF1 model induces more ordering at the interface, though int. widths still agree with experiment.

Average density:
Cannot distinguish the interfacial region from the liquid region in the profiles. Bulk density is not recovered by the end of the simulation box. 

Diffusion coefficient:
If they are taking z-slices and calculatin diffusion constants for each, how do they treat molecules traversing along the z-axis during the correlation?
They found that the RMSD for the Prismatic interfacial layers was larger than that of the Basal. This is what we would expect if the Prismatic surface has lower friction.},

abstract = {We have investigated the structural and dynamic properties of the basal and prismatic facets of the ice Ih/water interface when the solid phase is drawn through the liquid (i.e., sheared relative to the fluid phase). To impose the shear, we utilized a velocity-shearing and scaling approach to reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics. This method can create simultaneous temperature and velocity gradients and allow the measurement of transport properties at interfaces. The interfacial width was found to be independent of the relative velocity of the ice and liquid layers over a wide range of shear rates. Decays of molecular orientational time correlation functions gave similar estimates for the width of the interfaces, although the short- and longer-time decay components behave differently closer to the interface. Although both facets of ice are in "stick" boundary conditions in liquid water, the solid-liquid friction coefficients were found to be significantly different for the basal and prismatic facets of ice.},

It is readily available, transparent, optically birefringent, and probing it in the laboratory does not require cryogenics or ultrahigh vacuum apparatus. Systematic study reveals the range of critical phenomena, equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase-transitions, and, most relevant to this review, premelting, that are traditionally studied in more simply bound solids. While this makes investigation of ice as a material appealing from the perspective of the physicist, its ubiquity and importance in the natural environment also make ice compelling to a broad range of disciplines in the Earth and planetary sciences. In this review we describe the physics of the premelting of ice and its relationship with the behavior of other materials more familiar to the condensed-matter community. A number of the many tendrils of the basic phenomena as they play out on land, in the oceans, and throughout the atmosphere and biosphere are developed.},

abstract = {Orientational order parameters for four crystallographically distinct ice/water interfaces are defined and measured in molecular dynamics computer simulations of the CF1 central force model of water. We find that all interfaces are broad, with consistently different orientational structures found among the four interfaces. We also define and measure a local order parameter in the interfaces related to oxygen–oxygen coordination number, and show that this measure of the interfacial width is extremely broad. Combining recent results for the translational order parameters, average density order parameters and diffusion coefficient order parameters, for this model of water, coupled with other simulations of rigid models of water, a clear picture of the structure of the ice/water interface emerges. This also reveals a possible explanation for the differential accumulation of certain solutes at the ice/water interface.},

Translational (density), orientational (static angles), and oxygen-oxygen coordination number profiles perpendicular to the ice/water interface were accumulated, and using smoothing functions 10{\%}-90{\%} interfacial widths were determined.

The orientational order parameter for each of the two angles investigated lead to varying interfacial widths amongst the four facets, this indicates a difference in dipole moment at the ice surface. We believe this same difference in dipole moment may be responsible for some of the discrepencies in friction amongst the four ice facets in our work.},

This wide variation persists even in the more recent experiments in which values of about 1, 0.77 ?? 0.06, and 0.2 ?? 0.1 have been reported. However, current molecular dynamics simulations of water consistently result in a condensation coefficient of about 1. These water models may overestimate the condensation coefficient by assigning condensed phase parameters to the bulk, surface, and gas phase water molecules in the simulations. We varied the dipole moment and the Lennard-Jones parameters for a gas phase water molecule in a condensation simulation using the SPC/E model. With modest changes to the dipole moment and the Lennard-Jones parameters, we have obtained a value of 0.77. However, we have concluded that to obtain a simulation condensation coefficient of 0.2, unrealistic parameters must be assigned to the water molecules. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
